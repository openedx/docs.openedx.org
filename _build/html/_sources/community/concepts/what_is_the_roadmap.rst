######################################

.. tags:: community, concept

The `Open edX Product Roadmap`_ is the way in which the Open edX community comes together to collaboratively develop and advance the Open edX platform.

What are the goals of the Roadmap?
******************************************

The goals of the Roadmap are as follows:

#. To comprehensively document all current, planned work in-flight across the Open edX ecosystem.

#. To track and prioritize proposed work that is not yet in-flight.


Why do we need a Roadmap?
***********************************

Ideally, a comprehensive, up-to-date Roadmap would answer questions such as:

* What product use cases (and subsequent areas of the platform) have been collectively prioritized for investment by the community?

* What features or updates can we expect in the upcoming :ref:`Named Release<Open edX Release Notes>`?

* We would like to invest in Enhancement X. Is anyone else investing there?

* Has work on Issue Y been completed?

* What was the scope and approach taken to Issue Z?

* We would like to see work on Idea Z but cannot take it on now (or alone). Are there partnership opportunities available to advance it?

How Do I Read the Roadmap?
**************************************

The Roadmap is a Kanban-style board, organized into 7 main status categories nested within swimlanes.

See the :ref:`How to Read the Roadmap` how-to guide for more information.

Who maintains and updates the Roadmap?
*************************************************

The Roadmap is stewarded by `Axim Collaborative`_ and the `Product Working Group`_. The Product Working Group is an `Open edX Working Group`_ that is open for anyone in the community to join. We meet biweekly and we'd love to see you at an upcoming meeting! Find the latest meeting time on the `Open edX Meeting Calendar`_.

What is the current status of the Roadmap?
**************************************************

The Roadmap is an iterative work-in-progress. The goal of the roadmap is to ensure all in-flight work across the ecosystem is represented on the Roadmap. This includes contributions from Axim, 2U/edX, and all contributing Providers.

Can I add my organization's contributions to the Roadmap?
********************************************************************

Yes! We need your participation in order to make the Roadmap a successful and meaningful artifact. Please follow the `Product Review Process`_ to submit your product proposal - whether it's a rough idea or an initiative your team is planning to complete - to the roadmap.
