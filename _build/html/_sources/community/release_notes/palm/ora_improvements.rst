Enhanced ORA Grading Experience (Palm)
######################################

In the latest Open edX release, Palm, the ORA (Open Response Assessment) tool
has been upgraded to provide a better grading experience for course instructors.

What has changed?
*****************

In this new on-platform grading experience, one can assign rubric values,
provide comments, and coordinate grading with all members of the course teams.
Additionally, graders can  easily preview common file types, including:

* Images (gif, png, jpeg)
* Plain-text (with monotype fonts and line feeds intact)
* .txt tabular data (.csv files will not preview)
* PDFs, including multi-page PDFs with page selection

From the ORA grading interface, instructors can select multiple submissions and
click the :guilabel:`View` button to enter a grading mode for those submissions:

In the grading mode, there are four things to note, illustrated in this picture
and described below:

#. This is a display of a learner's username, the status of their submission (for
   example, “Grading Complete” or “Currently being graded by someone else”), and
   their current score.

#. “Show Rubric” is a button that, when clicked, displays the rubric on the
   right hand side of the learner's submission:

#. When “Override Grade” is selected, the above rubric display becomes editable.
   Grade line items and comments can be changed.

   The score information is not saved until pressing the submit button. This
   means you can score a response, move on to another, and then go back to the
   first response and change the grade again - all without pushing scores to the
   LMS for persistence.

#. The page selector allows course staff to navigate through the submissions.

Pay attention to the fact that Grade Override is a permanent action; it cannot
be undone. Course staff are given a prompt before entering Grade Override mode
to make sure that is understood.
