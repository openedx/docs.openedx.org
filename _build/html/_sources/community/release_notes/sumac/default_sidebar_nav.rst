Sidebar Navigation Release Notes (Sumac)
########################################

The Product, Design, and Engineering Teams at Western Governor's University,
Raccoon Gang, and Axim Collaborative are thrilled to offer a new method for
navigating course content on the Open edX platform! With the Sumac Release, the
sidebar navigation will be offered as the default course navigation experience,
giving learners and course delivery teams a new method for making their way
through course content. Site operators should see :doc:`dev_op_release_notes`
