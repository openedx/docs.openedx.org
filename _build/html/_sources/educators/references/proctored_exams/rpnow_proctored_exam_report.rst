.. _Proctoring Results Review Status Column RPNow:

======================================
Values in the ``review_status`` Column
======================================

After learners complete a proctored exam, a reviewer from the proctoring
service provider reviews the exam according to specific criteria, including the
:ref:`Online Proctoring Rules <Online Proctoring Rules>`. The value in the
``review_status`` column shows the outcome of the proctored exam review.

Additionally, the value in the ``review_status`` column affects the following
information for the course team and for the learner.

* The values in the ``status`` column.
* The proctoring result that is visible on the learner exam page and in the
  email notification that the learner receives.

For example, if the ``review_status`` column has a value of "Clean", the value
in the ``status`` column is "verified". On the learner exam page and in the
email notification, the status of the exam is "Satisfactory".

If the ``review_status`` column has a value of "Suspicious", the value
in the ``status`` column is "rejected". On the learner exam page and in the
email notification, the status of the exam is "Unsatisfactory".

The following table describes the possible values in the ``review_status``
column.
