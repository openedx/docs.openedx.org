About the Iframe Tool
########################

.. tags:: educator, concept

The iframe tool allows you to integrate ungraded exercises and tools from any
Internet site into the body of your course. It places an iframe inside an HTML
component, and then the exercise or tool appears inside the iframe. The iframe
can include your own tools or third-party tools.

Before you make content or a tool from an external site available through your
course, be sure to review the content or tool to ensure that it is accessible
to people with disabilities. For example, in addition to testing the iframe
components that you add to your course, you can ask third party providers to
confirm that a tool is accessible, and, if available, contact your on campus
accessibility support services for additional guidance. For more information,
see :ref:`Accessibility Best Practices Checklist`.

Iframes are well-suited for tools that demonstrate a concept, but that are not
graded or used to store student data. If you want to add a graded tool or
exercise, add the tool as a :ref:`custom JavaScript problem<Guide to Custom JavaScript Display and Grading Problem>`
or an :ref:`LTI component<About the LTI Component>`.
