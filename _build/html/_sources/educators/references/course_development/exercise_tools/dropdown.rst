Dropdown Problem
################

.. tags:: educator, reference

The dropdown problem type is a simple problem type that serves as another format
for single-select problem asking. Dropdown problems include a question or prompt
and several answer options with a single correct answer. By adding hints,
feedback, or both, you can give learners guidance and help.

For more information about the simple problem types, see
:ref:`Working with Problem Components`.

Overview
********

In dropdown problems, learners select one answer from a list of answer options.
Unlike :ref:`single select<Single Select>` problems, where the answer
choices are always visible directly below the question, the answer options for
dropdown problems do not appear until the learner selects the dropdown arrow.

Dropdown problems can only have one correct answer per question. Use the
:ref:`multi-select problem type <Add a Multi Select Problem>` for a scenario
with more than one correct answer.

Example Dropdown Problem
************************

In the LMS, learners select a single answer option to complete a dropdown
problem. An example of a dropdown problem from the learner's perspective follows.

Advanced Example: In-Line (In-Sentence) Dropdown
************************************************

With advanced editing in Studio, you can include a dropdown selection in a
sentence or line of text. This format helps learners decide from options within
a sentence or in-line without using long single-select choice options or
non-ideal formatting of the dropdown problem. See the example application given.
You can use more than one dropdown input in a sentence or section of text. You
can also add dropdown problems within tables. For instructions, see :ref:`Creating In-Line Dropdown`.

Selecting an option looks like this:

And grading appears as follows:
