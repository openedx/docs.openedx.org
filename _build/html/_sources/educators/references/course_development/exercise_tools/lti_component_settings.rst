   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - Display Name
     - Specifies the name of the component. This name appears as a heading
       above the problem. Unique, descriptive display names help you
       identify problems quickly and accurately for analysis.

   * - LTI Application Information
     - The description of the remote LTI application. If the application
       requires a username or email address, use this field to inform learners
       that their information will be forwarded to the external application.

   * - LTI Version
     - Used to select the LTI version used for the current LTI component.

   * - LTI ID (LTI 1.1 only)
     - Specifies the LTI ID for the remote LTI tool provider. This value must
       match the LTI ID that you entered as part of the LTI passport string for
       the LTI tool. For more information about LTI passports, see
       :ref:`enable_lti_components`.

   * - LTI URL (LTI 1.1 only)
     - Specifies the URL of the remote LTI tool that this component launches.

   * - LTI 1.3 Tool Launch URL (LTI 1.3 only)
     - Specifies the URL of the remote LTI tool that this component launches.
       This is sometimes called *Redirect URL* in some tools.

   * - LTI 1.3 OIDC URL (LTI 1.3 only)
     - Specifies the URL of the login URL for the remote LTI tool for the
       authentication flow. This can also be called *Login URL* on some tools.

   * - LTI 1.3 Tool Public Key (LTI 1.3 only)
     - The LTI 1.3 tool's public key. This is a string that starts with
       '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----' and is required so that the LMS can check if
       the messages and launch requests received have the signature from the tool.
       This is not required when doing LTI 1.3 Launches without LTI Advantage.

   * - Deep linking (LTI 1.3 only)
     - Toggle to enable or disable LTI Advantage Deep Linking. Select **True** if
       the tool supports this feature and you want to use it in this component.

   * - LTI Advantage Deep Linking Launch URL (LTI 1.3 only)
     - Specifies the URL of the remote LTI tool that this component uses to perform
       deep linking launches. If not specified by the tool, use the same URL as
       in **LTI 1.3 Tool Launch URL**.

   * - LTI Assignment and Grades Service (LTI 1.3 only)
     - Toggle to enable LTI Advantage Assignment and Grades services and set the
       grading model.

       Options are:

       * **Disabled** - LTI AGS service will be disabled. Use this for tools that
         don't send any grades back to the platform.

       * **Allow tools to submit grades only (declarative) (Default)** - the platform
         will enable LTI AGS and prepare a single grade container for problems to
         send grades back to. Use this for simple LTI problems.

       * **Allow tools to manage and submit grade (programmatic)** - The tool will have
         full control over the grading process, enabling it to create and edit one or
         more grade containers and manage the learner scores that will be reported
         to the LMS.

   * - Custom Parameters
     - Sends additional parameters that are required by the remote LTI tool.
       The parameters that you send depend on the specific LTI tool you are
       using.

       Supply a key and value for each custom parameter. The key is an
       identifier for the parameter. Use the following format.

       ``{key}={value}``

       For example, an LTI tool that displays an e-book might accept a ``page``
       parameter to control which page the e-book opens to by default. The
       following example sends a ``page`` parameter to an LTI tool.

       ::

          ["page=144"]

   * - LTI Launch Target
     - Controls the way that the course page will open and display the remote
       LTI tool.

       Options are:

       * **Inline** - the LTI tool will appear directly in the course page.

       * **Modal** - the LTI tool will appear in a separate display window in
         front of the course page. The modal display window prevents learners
         from interacting with the course page until they dismiss the LTI tool.

       * **New Window** - the LTI tool will appear in a new web browser window.
         Depending on the configuration of the web browser, it may appear in a
         new tab or in a separate browser window. Learners can interact with
         both the course page and the LTI tool.

   * - Button Text
     - Enter a custom label for the button that opens the external LTI tool.

   * - Inline Height
     - Specifies the on-screen height of the LTI tool in pixels.

       This setting is only applied if the **LTI Launch Target** is set to
       **Inline**.

   * - Modal Height
     - Specifies the on-screen height of the LTI content window as a percentage
       of the visible web browser window height. Enter the percentage in whole numbers.

       This setting is only applied if the **LTI Launch Target** control is set
       to **Modal**.

   * - Modal Width
     - Specifies the on-screen width of the LTI content window as a percentage
       of the web browser window width. Enter the percentage in whole numbers.

       This setting is only applied if the **LTI Launch Target** control is set
       to **Modal**.

   * - Scored
     - Indicates whether the LTI component receives a numerical score from the
       remote LTI tool provider. By default, this value is set to **False**.

   * - Weight
     - Specifies the number of points possible for a problem. By default, if a
       remote LTI tool provider grades the problem, the problem is worth one
       point, and a learner's score can be any value between zero and one.

       This setting is only applied if **Scored** is set to **True**.

       For more information about problem weights and computing point scores,
       see :ref:`Problem Weight`.

   * - Hide External Tool
     - Controls whether the LTI component will display the remote LTI tool on
       the course page.

       Set the value to **True** to prevent the course page from displaying the
       remote LTI tool. For example, you might use an LTI component to
       synchronize with a remote grading system. In that situation, the LTI
       component should not appear on the course page.

       Set the value to **False** to display the remote LTI tool and allow
       learners to interact with it.

   * - Accept grades past deadline
     - Specifies whether third-party systems are allowed to post grades after
       the deadline. By default, this value is set to **True**.

   * - Request user's email
     - Sends the learner's email address to the remote LTI tool.

       An LTI component will only send learners' email addresses if the **LTI
       Launch Target** control is set to **New Window**. When the new window
       launches, the learners are warned that if they continue, their email
       address will be shared with the LTI provider.


       By default, this setting is not available in Studio.
        To make this setting available, a system administrator must enable the
        setting in the Django administration console.

   * - Request user's username
     - Sends the learner's username to the remote LTI tool. This is the
       username that the learner used to register for the course.

       An LTI component will only send learners' usernames if the **LTI Launch
       Target** control is set to **New Window**. When the new window
       launches, the learners are warned that if they continue, their username
       will be shared with the LTI provider.

       By default, this setting is not available in Studio.

        To make this setting available in Studio, a system administrator must
        enable the setting in the Django administration console.
