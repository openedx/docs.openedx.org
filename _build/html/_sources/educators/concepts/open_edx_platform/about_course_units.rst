****************************
What is a Unit?
****************************

A unit is a part of a :ref:`subsection<About Course Subsections>` that
learners view as a single page.

A unit contains one or more :ref:`components<Add a Component>`,
such as text with :ref:`HTML<About Text Components>` markup,
:ref:`problems<Working with Problem Components>`, or a
:ref:`video<Working with Video Components>`.

In Studio, when you select a unit name in the outline, the **Unit** page opens.

#. Options for testing the unit.
#. Status panel for the unit.
#. A unit navigation bar that shows where in the subsection this unit is located, and provides easy navigation options to nearby unit pages.

****************************
Viewing Units as a Learner
****************************

To a learner using the learning management system 
(LMS), each unit in the
subsection is represented by an icon in the unit navigation bar at the top of
the **Course** page. The current unit is indicated with bold underlining in the
unit navigation bar. The components in the current unit appear below the unit navigation bar.

The following image shows a subsection in the LMS that contains several units.

.. image:: /_images/educator_references/Units_LMS.png
 :alt: A unit in the LMS, with all of the unit icons in the unit navigation bar
  indicated. Green check marks are visible for some units.
 :width: 500

A green check mark next to a unit icon indicates that a learner has completed
the unit. A learner has completed the unit if the learner has completed all the
following actions.

* Viewed all of each video.
* Submitted answers for all of the problems.
* Viewed all HTML content for at least five seconds.
