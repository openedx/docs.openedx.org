.. tags:: educator, concept


Content experiments enable showing different course content to different groups of learners. Also known as “A/B tests” or “split tests”, content experiments allow an instructor or researcher to compare the performance or engagement of learners in different groups. This function also enables per-unit randomization for other purposes such as the assessment of learning. See :ref:`Randomize Units for Assessment (Exams)`.

If your course uses content experiments, the grade report that you generate from the instructor dashboard includes a column identifying the experiment group that each learner has been assigned to. For more information, see :ref:`Guide to the Grade Report`.

.. important:: Content experiments do not display correctly in the mobile apps. Blocks created with Content Experiment components display in the mobile app with a "Group ID" label.

You can add a content experiment in a unit or container page. In Studio, you create and view content for all groups in the content experiment in a container page for the experiment, as shown in :ref:`Create Content for Content Experiment Groups`.

When a learner views a unit with the content experiment, they has no indication there is a content experiment in the unit, and the content experiment display name is not shown. She sees only the content that you configure for the group she is assigned to. To the learner, the unit with the content experiment is no different than any other unit.

To configure a content experiment in Studio, visit :ref:`Manage Content Experiments`.

After you configure a content experiment, you can change its group configuration. For more information, see :ref:`Change Group Configuration for a Content Experiment`.

You can move a content experiment from its current location to a different location in the course outline. For information, see :ref:`Reorganize a Component`.

.. _Courses with Multiple Content Experiments:

******************************************
Courses with Multiple Content Experiments
******************************************

You can run multiple content experiments in your course. You can set up each experiment to use the same groups of learners, or you can set up each experiment to be independent and use a different grouping.

.. important::

  If your course has multiple experiments, it is critical that you decide in advance if the experiments share the same groups of learners or if each experiment has its own unique grouping. If two experiments share the same grouping, then any learner that is in Group A for the first experiment will also be in Group A for the second one. If you want the experiments to be independent, then the experiments must use different groupings so that learners are randomly assigned for each experiment.

To determine the available groupings of learners, you set up group configurations from :ref:`Set Up Group Configuration for OLX Courses`.

You then select which group configuration to use when you add a content experiment :ref:`using Studio <Create a Content Experiment>` or :ref:`Add a Content Experiment in OLX`.

.. note::

  To see a research use case of the content experiment, view `The Effect of Course Content Position on Student Attempts of Practice Problems in Introductory Biology <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8534635>`_.
