Content groups are virtual groupings of learners who will see a particular set
of course content. You can use content groups to designate specific course
content as available to particular :ref:`cohorts<About Learner Cohorts>` of learners.

You create content groups in Studio, and in your course outline you use the
**Access Settings** to designate whether a component is selectively available
only to one or more content groups. Any course components that do not have an
explicit restricted access setting are available to all learners, regardless of
their cohort.

Content groups do not have an actual impact on the availability of a course
component until you associate them with one or more cohorts. If you have
designated certain course content as restricted to a content group, and in
addition have associated that content group with one or more cohorts, then
only learners in those cohorts will see the designated content.

For an example of using content groups to create cohort-specific course
content, see :ref:`Cohorted Courseware Example`.
