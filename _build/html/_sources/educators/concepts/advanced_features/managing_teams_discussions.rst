About Managing Teams Discussions
#################################

.. tags:: educator, concept

The Open EdX community recommends that you designate course staff and
optionally student teaching assistants (TAs) to moderate team discussions. The
same discussion administration roles for managing course discussions on the
**Discussions** page apply to discussion administration for team discussions.
Course team members and student TAs who already have discussion moderation
roles for course discussions on the **Discussions** page can perform the same
roles for discussions in teams.

For information about discussion administration roles, see
:ref:`Assign discussion roles`. For information about managing discussions,
see :ref:`Best Practices for Configuring Course Discussions`.

Ability to Post in Team Discussions
***********************************

Members of the team, discussion community TAs, and course staff with the roles
of Discussion Admin or Discussion Moderator can post to a team's discussion.
Team members can edit their own posts, reply to posts and comments, follow and
flag posts, and so on.

Posts made by discussion community TAs are marked with a **Community TA** label
in the discussion navigation pane, and those made by discussion moderators or
discussion admins are marked with a **Staff** label.

Ability to Edit or Delete Posts
*******************************

Discussion moderators, discussion admins, and community TAs can perform the
following actions in team discussions, without being a member of the team.

* Review, edit, or delete messages
* Pin, close, or reopen posts
* Endorse responses

Responses and comments made by community TAs have a **Community TA** label.

Responses and comments made by discussion moderators or discussion
administrators have a **Staff** label.
