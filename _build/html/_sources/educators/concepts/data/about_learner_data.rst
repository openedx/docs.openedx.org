Guidance for Working with Personal Information
**********************************************

The information that your instance collects from site registrants includes personal information that can be used to identify, contact, and locate individuals. This
information is available to course team members with the Admin or Staff role
for the learners who are enrolled in their courses.

Members of the course team should follow the policies established by their
organizations and comply with the legal requirements of their locales to
prevent public distribution or misuse of this information.

Accessing Learner Data
****************************

In the LMS, you can download data about the individuals who are currently
enrolled in your course in a .csv (comma-separated values) file. You can also
view data for enrolled learners on the instructor dashboard. For more
information, see :ref:`View learner data`.

For information about course enrollment, see :ref:`Enrollment`.

===========================
About Learner-Reported Data
===========================

When learners create or register their user accounts, they select a public
username and supply their full names and email addresses. Learners also have
the option to provide personal demographic information, including the highest
level of education completed, gender, year of birth, and preferred language.
Because this information is optional, not all of the learners who are enrolled
in your course provide it.

After learners create an account, they can enroll in as many individual courses
as they choose.

* The learner data that is available from the instructor dashboard reflects the
  set of live, current enrollments. Data for the course team, who are also
  enrolled in the course, is included.

* Learners can enroll in your course throughout the defined enrollment period,
  and they can unenroll from a course at any time.

* Learners can update their personal information at any time on the
  Account Settings page.

As a result, you might want to download learner data periodically to gain an
understanding of how the learner population changes over time.
