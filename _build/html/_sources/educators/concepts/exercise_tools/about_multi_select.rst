The multi-select problem type is a simple problem type that can be added to any
course. At a minimum, multi-select problems include a question or prompt and
several answer options. By adding hints, feedback, or both, you can give
learners guidance and help when they work on a problem.

**********
Overview
**********

In multi-select problems, learners select one or more options from a list of
possible answers. To answer the problem correctly, a learner must select all
of the options that are correct answers, and none of the options that are
incorrect. The course team must set up each multi-select problem to have at least
one correct answer.

As a best practice, ensure all answer choices are unambiguous and
avoid trick questions. Multi-select problems with ambiguity can frustrate
learners, especially if the problems have a limited number of attempts.


Example Multi-select Problem
****************************

In the LMS, learners complete a multi-select problem by selecting the correct answers and leaving the incorrect ones unselected. An example of a completed multi-select
problem follows, selecting the correct answers and leaving the incorrect ones unselected.

    answered because the learner selected only two of the three required answer
    options. An explanation appears below the answer options because the
    learner also selected "Show Answer".

This problem was incorrectly answered because the learner selected only two of
the three required answer options. This example also shows that the learner
selected **Show Answer** to reveal the correct answer and an explanation.
