.. tags:: educator, concept

In single select problems, learners select one option from a list of answer
options. Unlike :ref:`dropdown<Dropdown>` problems, where the answer choices
do not appear until the learner selects the dropdown arrow, answer choices for
single select problems are immediately visible directly below the question.

Single select problems can also have several advanced options, such as
reordering, or shuffling, the set of answer choices for each learner. For more
information about these options, see
:ref:`Editing Single Select Problems using the Advanced Editor`.

Example Single Select Problem
*******************************

In the LMS, learners select a single answer option to complete a single
select problem. An example of a completed single select problem follows.

   the answer options was incorrectly selected. An explanation appears below
   the answer options.

Pedagogical Considerations for Single Select Questions
*******************************************************

It is recommended the use, whenever possible, of authentic assessment rather than
single select questions for graded problems. The use of authentic assessment
in online courses tends to lead to better learning outcomes. In addition,
authentic assessment allows for infinite attempts, mastery learning, and more
intellectual risk taking, which lead to substantially better learning outcomes.

Single select questions do have these uses.

* Ungraded single select questions can help students think about a concept in
  the context of knowledge transfer.

* For many subject areas, authentic assessments are either unavailable or
  prohibitively complex to use. In such courses, single select questions can
  act as the only available fall back.

Fortunately, single select questions are among the best studied in assessment
literature. A few guidelines for the creation of such questions follow.

* Organize the set of answers logically. Use consistent phrasing for the
  answers, and when possible, parallel structure.

* Place as many of the words in the stem as possible, and keep the answers as
  concise as possible.

* The distractors should not be substantially shorter, longer, or use different
  structure than the correct answer. The answer options should be as consistent
  in structure, length, and phrasing as possible.

* Avoid using negatives (and especially double negatives) in the question and
  the answers.

* Test higher order thinking (comprehension and critical thinking). Avoid
  simple recall.

* If you specify a finite number of attempts, avoid trick questions and try to
  keep wording clear and unambiguous.

* Make all distractors plausible.

* Use "All of the above" and "None of the above" answer options with caution.
  If a learner can identify at least two correct answers, it can give away the
  answer with only partial comprehension.
