The Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) component allows you to integrate
remote learning tools into your course, such as applications and textbooks.
This component supports tools that comply with the `LTI 1.1`_ and `LTI 1.3`_ specifications.
Additionally, the LTI 1.3 tools can use the following LTI Advantage extensions:
`Deep Linking`_, `Assignments and Grades services`_ and
`Names and Roles Provisioning Service`_.

Overview
*********************

The LTI component enhances the learning experience by enabling integration between the LMS and external tools. It can be used in several ways.

* **Embed External Learning Tools:** Integrate third-party tools, such as coding platforms, simulations, and adaptive learning systems, directly into your LMS.

* **Facilitate Interactive Learning & Assessments:** Allow students to engage with external quizzes, assignments, and interactive exercises, with grading handled by the tool provider.

* **Synchronize Grades with External Systems:** Ensure automatic grade synchronization between an LTI tool and the LMS gradebook.

* **Support Video Conferencing & Collaboration:** Integrate virtual classrooms and peer review tools to foster engagement and collaboration.

For example, the following LTI component integrates a Cerego tool that learners
interact with into the LMS for a course.

  before making them available through your course. For more information, see
  :ref:`Accessibility Best Practices Checklist`.

.. note::
  You can also integrate content from a course into a remote learning management system such as Canvas or Blackboard.
