Randomized Content Blocks

.. tags:: educator, concept

If your course has :ref:`content libraries<Content Libraries Overview>` enabled and you
have access to a library whose content you want to use, you can reference that
library to create randomized assignments for students.

To create a randomized assignment, you add one or more randomized content
blocks to a course unit. For each randomized content block, specify a library
from which to draw the content, and indicate the number and optionally the type
of problem to randomly give each student.

The libraries that you create or have access to are listed on the **Libraries**
tab on the Studio Home page. For details about content libraries, see
:ref:`Content Libraries Overview`.
