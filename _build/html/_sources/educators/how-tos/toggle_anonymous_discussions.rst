There are two options for anonymous discussion posts.

1. Allow Anonymous Discussion Posts - Posts can be made anonymously to *everyone*, including discussion admins.
2. Allow Anonymous Discussion Posts to Peers - Posts can be made anonymously to *other classmates*. Discussion Admins can view the author.

Generally, you'll choose one or none of the options based on your course policies.


	Note that an admin must be a "Discussion Admin" in order to view anonymous posts. This role is separate from a course staff or course admin.
