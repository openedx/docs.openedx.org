Build a Collection in a Library
###############################

.. tags:: educator, how-to


Collections function as subsets of content within a Library, and are one of the
primary ways to manage and organize large sets of content. For example, a
collection may be built around content about a particular topic, or a set of
problems for an assessment.

.. note::

    Content authors can create as many collections as they would like within a
    Library. Content may be added to, or removed from, a Collection at any time.
    
    One piece of content can live in many collections.
