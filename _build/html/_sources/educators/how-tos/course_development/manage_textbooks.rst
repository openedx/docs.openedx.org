You can add textbooks in PDF format to your course.

.. note::
   Do not use image files (for example, .png files) as textbooks for your
   course, because they are not accessible to learners who use screen readers.
   For more information, review :ref:`Creating Accessible PDFs`.

Each textbook you add is displayed to learners as a page, or tab, in the
course navigation bar. The recommendation is to upload a separate PDF for each
chapter of your textbook.

When learners open the textbook page in the course, they can navigate
the textbook by chapter.
