Libraries now support the ability to edit in draft mode, enabling more flexible
content creation workflows.

There are three publishing statuses:

* **Draft mode**: Content has never been published
* **Published**: Content is published and available for reuse
* **Published, with pending edits**: Content has been revised since it was last published

Only published content is available for reuse in courses.
