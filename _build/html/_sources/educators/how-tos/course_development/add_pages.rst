.. _Adding Pages to a Course:

Managing the Pages in Your Course

.. tags:: educator, how-to

This topic describes the applications and resources that your course experience
has enabled outside of the core content experience and how you can modify these
tools to fit your course needs.

.. _Default Pages:

*******************************
Working with the Default Pages
*******************************

By default, every new course has the following key areas enabled:

* Course
* Progress
* Date
* Discussion


In the learner experience, these will be shown in the primary navigation bar at the top of every page,
consistently in this order for all courses.

As a course team member with the **Staff** or **Admin** role, you also see the Instructor
option in the navigation bar, shown at the end of the list of pages.
Learners do not see the Instructor option.

.. note::
    The progress page can be disabled and thus hidden from the learner experience,
    though this is not commonly done and is not recommended. The information on
    the Progress page is critical for motivating learners, particularly in courses
    that include graded subsections, but also for courses that include only ungraded
    exercises. Before choosing to hide the Progress page for your course, consider
    the possible effect on learner engagement.
