#. Select **Edit**. The **Editing** dialog box opens.

   Configure your drag and drop problem. For detailed information about

     feedback for the problem. For more information about how the text in these
     fields appears in a drag and drop problem, see
     :ref:`overview_of_drag_and_drop_problems`.

   * Specify a background image in the **Background URL** field. Enter the URL
     of a file you have added to your course or the URL of an image on the web.

.. _Styling Drag and Drop Problems:

Changing the Visual Style of a Drag and Drop Problem
****************************************************

You can change the visual appearance of drag and drop problems in your courses.

The **Background color** and **Text color** controls for the draggable items in
a drag and drop problem set the appearance of items for an individual problem.
You can choose colors for the background and text of items when you create or
edit a drag and drop problem.

You can develop a Python programming language module and include a custom
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file for drag and drop problems in your Open edX
site. For more information, see :ref:`Styling Drag and Drop Problems`.
