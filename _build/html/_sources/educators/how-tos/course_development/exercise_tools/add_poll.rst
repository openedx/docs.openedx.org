***************************
Editing Published Polls
***************************

Do not publish a poll until you have completed and tested it. You should
avoid changing a poll after learners have begun to use it.

If you must edit a poll after learners have submitted answers take into account
the following implications.

* If you edit the value of an answer, previous submissions are associated with
  the new answer value. This change can result in an inaccurate picture of the
  responses.

* If you change the poll so that previous submissions are invalid, by removing
  an answer, those submissions are deleted when learners next view the unit.
  Learners with invalid submissions can submit new responses.

***************************
View Poll Results
***************************

When you view the poll as a course staff member, you can view results of the
poll inside the course.

#. Select **View results** in the poll.
