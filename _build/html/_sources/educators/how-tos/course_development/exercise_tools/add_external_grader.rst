To create a code response problem in Studio, follow these steps.

#. In the unit where you want to add the code response problem, select
   **Problem** under **Add New Component**.

#. In the list that opens, select the **Advanced** tab, and then select **Blank
   Advanced Problem**. The :ref:`advanced editor <Advanced Editor>` opens.

#. In the new component, select **Edit**.

#. In the problem editor, enter the online learning XML (OLX) definition for
   the problem that you created.

#. Select **Save**.

#. Test the problem in the LMS.

.. note::
   To validate your external grader and test a problem, you must view the
   component in a published unit in the LMS. If you test a problem in Studio,
   you receive an “Error: No grader has been set up for this problem” message.
