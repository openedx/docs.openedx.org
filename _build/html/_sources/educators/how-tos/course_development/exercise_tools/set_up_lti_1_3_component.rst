Set Up an LTI 1.3 Component
###########################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

To add an LTI 1.3 component to a course unit, follow these steps.

#. Edit the unit in which you want to add the remote LTI tool and select
   **Advanced** from the **Add New Component** section. Select **LTI
   Consumer**.

   If the **Advanced** component type is not available, make sure you have
   enabled LTI components. To do this, see :ref:`enable_lti_components`.

#. Select **Edit** in the component that appears.

#. In the **LTI Version** field, select **LTI 1.3**.

#. Enter the LTI 1.3 settings provided from your tool. For basic LTI 1.3
   tools, without LTI Advantage, you need to set the following settings:

   * **LTI 1.3 Tool Launch URL** (can also be called redirect url)
   * **LTI 1.3 OIDC URL** (can also be called login url)

   To enable *LTI Advantage* features, such as grades pass back and Deep
   Linking, you also need to set **LTI 1.3 Tool Public Key** with a key
   provided by the LTI tool. The key will look similar to this example:

   .. code-block:: bash

        -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
        MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEApAbQVx8FLXOflwvmV4dE

        IQIDAQAB
        -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

   You should paste the key from the tool directly into the configuration
   field. For more information about each setting, see :ref:`LTI Component
   settings`.

#. Select **Save**.

#. The Studio page will refresh and display LTI configuration required by the
   tool. Copy each of those values and follow the instructions provided by the
   tool to set them up.

   For basic LTI 1.3 launches, the following configuration values are required
   (they are provided by the LTI tool being set up):

   * **Client**
   * **Deployment ID**
   * **Keyset URL**
   * **OIDC Callback URL** (some tools refer to this as launch or redirect
     urls).

   For LTI Advantage, you'll also need to set **OAuth Token URL** (token/login
   url) in the tool.

.. note:: LTI 1.3 launches only work with published blocks, make sure the block
     is published before doing a launch.
