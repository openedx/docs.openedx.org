Overview
*********

You can include polls in your course to gather learners' opinions on various
questions.

For a poll, you configure one question and multiple possible
answers. If you need to ask multiple questions, use the :ref:`Survey Tool <Manage Survey Tool>`.

The following example poll has four possible answers to the question.

After learners submit their answers to the poll question, they see the poll
results that have been gathered at this time, unless the poll has been
configured to hide results.

Before you can add a poll to your course, you must enable the poll tool in
Studio or OLX (open learning XML).

To enable the poll tool in Studio, you add the ``"poll"`` key to the **Advanced
Module List** on the **Advanced Settings** page. (Be sure to include the
quotation marks around the key value.) For more information, see
