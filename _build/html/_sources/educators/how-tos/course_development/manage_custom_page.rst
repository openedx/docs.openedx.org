You can customize your course by adding pages. Each page that you add appears in the navigation
bar for your course. When you add a page, you add its content using an HTML editor.
The following example shows the navigation bar for a course that has added a custom page named Syllabus.

When you add a page, you can specify whether it and its content are visible only to course team
members who have the Admin or Staff role, or to all enrolled learners as well as the course team.
For more information about assigning course team roles, see :ref:`Guide to Course Team Roles` and :ref:`Add Course Team Members`.

If you add a custom page to a course after its start date, and have specified that the page should
be visible to learners, the page is visible in the LMS as soon as you save your work.

As a best practice, be sure the following aspects of your page design are ready before you add a page
in Studio.

* The content for the page, which can include HTML markup.
* The name of the page.
* The audience for the page (everyone, or course team members with the Admin or Staff roles only).

To add a custom page and its content to your course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Pages & Resources**.
#. Select the **Custom Pages** card on this page.
#. Click **New Page**, which prompts the system to add a page named **Empty** to the end of the list.
#. In the row for the new page, select **Edit**. The :ref:`visual editor<The Visual Editor>` opens.
#. Enter the content for your page.

    To add HTML tags to your content, select HTML to open the :ref:`the raw HTML editor<The Raw HTML Editor>`.
    For more information about entering content, see :ref:`Options for Editing Text Components`.

    .. note:: If you copy text from another source and paste it into the visual editor, be sure to proofread the result carefully. Some applications automatically change quotation marks and apostrophes from the “straight” version to the “smart” or “curly” version. The raw HTML editor requires “straight” quotation marks and apostrophes.

#. To rename the page, select Settings, and then enter a Display Name. The display name is the label that course participants use in the course navigation bar.
#. To hide the page from learners, select **Settings**, and then select true for **Hide Page from Learners**. By default, pages are visible to learners.
#. Select **Save**.

The new page is immediately available to the specified audience if the course has started.

.. _Reordering and deleting custom pages:

************************************
Reorder and Delete Custom Pages
************************************

You can reorder the custom pages in your course in the same way that you :ref:`reorganize the course outline<Reorganize the Course Outline>`:
you drag a page to a different location in the list of pages and drop it there.

.. note:: All default course pages (Course, Progress, Dates, Discussion) and optional course applications (Notes, Teams, Wiki) appear in the navigation before any configured custom page resources. If you have configured any textbook resources, these are listed after custom pages.

To reorder the pages, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Pages & Resources**.
#. Select the **Custom Pages** card on this page.
#. On the list of pages, each page that you can move includes a Drag to reorder icon.
#. Move your pointer over the Drag to reorder icon for the page. Your pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.
#. Click and drag the page to the new location, and then release.

You can also delete a custom page from your course using the delete icon shown on each custom page from the **Custom Pages** Studio page.
If you delete a page after the course start date, note that the visibility of the page in the learner experience changes immediately.
