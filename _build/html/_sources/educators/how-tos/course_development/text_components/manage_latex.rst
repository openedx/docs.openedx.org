Work with LaTeX Code

.. tags:: educator, how-to

.. note:: LaTeX editor support was removed with the rollout of the new Course Authoring-based Text Editor in the Redwood release.


.. ==========================
.. Enable the LaTeX Processor
.. ==========================

.. The LaTeX processor is not enabled by default. To enable it, you have to change
.. the advanced settings in your course.

.. #. In Studio, select **Settings**, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

.. #. In the field for the **Enable LaTeX Compiler** policy key, change **false**
   to **true**.

.. #. At the bottom of the page, select **Save Changes**.

.. ==============================================
.. Add a Text Component that Contains LaTeX Code
.. ==============================================

.. When the LaTeX processor is enabled, you can create a Text component that
.. contains LaTeX code.

.. #. In the unit where you want to create the component, select **Text** under
   **Add New Component**, and then select **E-text Written in LaTeX**. The new
   component is added to the unit.

.. #. Select **Edit** to open the new component.

.. #. At the bottom of the component editor, select **Launch Latex Source
   Compiler**.

   The LaTeX editor opens.

.. #. Add your LaTeX code. To do this, complete either of the following
   procedures.

   * In the **High Level Source Editing** field, add your LaTeX code.

   * To upload a LaTeX file from your computer, select **Upload**.

.. #. Select **Save & Compile to edX XML**.

.. #. On the unit page, select **Preview** to verify that your content looks
   correct in the LMS.

   If you see errors, go back to the unit page. Select **Edit** to open the
   component again, and then select **Launch Latex Source Compiler** to edit
   the LaTeX code.

.. _import latex code:

.. ****************************************
.. Import LaTeX Code into a Text Component
.. ****************************************

.. You can import LaTeX code into a Text component. You might do this, for
.. example, if you want to create "beautiful math" such as the math in the
.. following image.

.. .. warning::
..    The LaTeX processor that Studio uses to convert LaTeX code to XML is a third
..    party tool. We recommend  you use this feature with caution. If you use
..    the tool, make sure you work with your partner manager.
