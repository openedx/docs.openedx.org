Create a Team

ideas for their own teams.

CSV upload tool. See :ref:`Manage Teams Membership via CSV Upload`

Course team members who have the **Staff**, **Admin**, **Discussion Admin**,
or **Discussion Moderator** role can create new teams within team-sets.
**Community TAs** and learners in the course can also create teams, although
learners can create a new team only in open team-sets and only if they do not
already belong to a team in that team-set.

To create a team, follow these steps.

#. From the **Teams** page in the LMS, select **Browse**, then select the
   team-set in which you want to create a team.

#. At the bottom of the list of teams within the team-set, select the **create
   a new team in this team-set** link.
