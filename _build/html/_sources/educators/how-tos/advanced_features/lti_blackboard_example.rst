.. _Open edX as an LTI Provider to Blackboard:

Use Open edX Platform as an LTI Provider to Blackboard (Example)
####################################################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

.. warning:: This feature was a closed pilot experiment. This feature is poorly documented and may not work properly.

To use Open edX course content in the Blackboard LMS, you add a new app to the course and then add external tool module items.

.. note:: This example relies on the use of a third-party tool. Because this
  tool is subject to change by its owner, the steps and illustrations provided
  here are intended as guidelines and not as exact procedures.

#. In Blackboard, select your course.

#. From the course control panel, select **Customizations**. In the **Tool
   Availability** section, verify that the LTI tool has been enabled.

#. Open a **Content Area** page, and from the **Build Content** menu select
   **Web Link**.

#. On the **Create Web Link** page, enter an identifying name and the URL for
   the edX content you want to include.

   The **URL** is the LTI URL that you determined for the course content.
