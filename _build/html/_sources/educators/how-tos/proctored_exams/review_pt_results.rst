#. To review an individual learner's session, click on the learner's name to pop out
   their detailed exam results in a new tab. Here you can review their exam data, including Video
   Monitoring, Online Violations, Verification scans, and Onboarding tabs to understand what infractions
   (if any) were flagged as suspicious

dashboard. You can use this report to view proctoring results for all learners,
or :ref:`determine whether a specific learner has passed the proctoring
review<Determine if Learner Passed Proctoring Review>`.

 The Proctored Exam Results report contains information about the proctoring
 review. The report does not include information about the learner's score on
 the exam. A learner might pass the proctoring review but not earn a high
 enough score to pass the exam itself.
