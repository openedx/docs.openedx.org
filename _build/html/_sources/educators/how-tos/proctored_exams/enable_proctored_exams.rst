To create a proctored exam, you modify the Proctored Exam Settings in Studio
to enable proctored exams, and then you modify the settings of a subsection to
specify that the subsection is a proctored exam.

To enable proctored exams in your course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, then select **Proctored Exam Settings**.

#. Locate the **Enable Proctored Exams** policy key. The default for this field
   is to be unchecked, meaning that proctored exams are not enabled.

#. Check the setting to enable proctored exams.

#. Select **Submit**. You can now create proctored exams in your course.

Configuring Proctoring Provider
*******************************

The choice of proctoring provider can be configured. Since Fall 2019,
the default proctoring provider is **RPNow** by PSI.  To use
**Proctortrack** by Verificient, please follow these steps to change
the proctoring provider:

.. warning:: Changing the proctoring provider for a course after
   proctored exams have been created in course content is not
   supported. Please create proctored exams only after making a final
   decision of which proctoring backend your course will use.


#. In Studio, select **Settings**, then select **Proctored Exam Settings**.

#. Locate the **Proctoring Provider** policy key.

#. Select the drop down, and change the value to the desired proctoring provider.

#. Select **Submit**.

After you enable proctored exams for your course and choose the
proctoring provider, you can create a proctored exam or a practice
proctored/onboarding exam.
