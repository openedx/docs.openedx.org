Allow Opting Out of Proctored Exams
###################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

When a proctored exam opens, by default, verified learners must take the exam
with proctoring.

.. note::
   If a learner opts to take an exam without proctoring, the exam will not be
   timed either. In effect, learners who opt out of proctoring will have
   unlimited time to complete the exam and could return to problem sets at
   any time. You can reduce the ability to view the exam by selecting a due
   date for the exam.

To enable the option for learners to opt out of proctored exams for a course,
follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, then select **Proctored Exam Settings**.

#. Locate the **Allow Opting Out of Proctored Exams** policy key. The default
   value is ``No``, which requires Verified and Master's learners to take
   proctored exams with proctoring.

#. Change the value of the setting to ``Yes``.

#. Select **Submit**.
