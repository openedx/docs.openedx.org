#. On the **Schedule & Details** page, locate the **Requirements** section.
#. Select the **Require students to pass an exam before accessing course
   materials** option.

After you save your changes, Studio automatically creates an **Entrance Exam**
section in your course outline. To add content to your entrance exam, go to the
course outline.

Adjust Scores in the Entrance Exam
**********************************

If you find an error in the exam after learners have taken it, and corrections
to the exam are unavoidable, you have several options to rescore the exam for
individual learners. These options are available on the instructor dashboard.

In the LMS, select **Instructor** to access the instructor dashboard, and then
select **Student Admin**. In the **Entrance Exam Grade Adjustment** section,
the following options are available.

* **Reset Student Attempts**: Reset the value for one particular learner's
  attempts back to zero so that the learner can begin work over again. For more
  information, see :ref:`reset_attempts`.

* **Rescore Student Submission**: Rescore the responses that a learner has
  submitted. For more information, see :ref:`rescore`.

* **Delete Student State for Problem**: Delete a learner's entire history for
  the exam from the database. For more information, see :ref:`delete_state`.

Another option on the instructor dashboard is **Show Background Task History
for Student**. If you reset learner attempts, rescore learner submissions, or
delete learner state, the operation runs in the background. If you want to see
a record of all the operations that have run for the entrance exam, select
**Show Background Task History for Student**.
