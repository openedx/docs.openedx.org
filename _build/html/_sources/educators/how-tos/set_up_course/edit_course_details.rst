After you create a course, the course opens in Studio automatically and you can
begin editing. Your next steps might include adding other :ref:`course team
members<Add Course Team Members>`, setting the course :ref:`start and end
dates<Set Course Schedule>`, or developing the :ref:`course
outline<Manage Course Outline>`.

When you return to Studio later, your **My Courses** dashboard page lists
the courses that you created as well as any courses for which you have course team privileges.

  After the end date for a course has passed, the course moves to the
  **Archived Courses** tab on the Studio dashboard. If the course that you want
  to edit is not visible on the **Courses** tab, look for the course on the
  **Archived Courses** tab.

To edit a course, select the course name. The Studio **Course Outline** page
appears.
