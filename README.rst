managed by the Open edX team.

The `Open edX Documentation`_ site contains complete documentation for:

* Educators

* Course Operators

* Site Operators

* Developers

Documentation for other components of the Open edX ecosystem is found in each component's repository.  When known, links to other documentation are provided in the `Open edX Documentation`_.


Submit Documentation Issues
******************************

We welcome input from the community on Open edX documentation.  You can
submit documentation issues in the `GitHub repository`_.


Contribute to Open edX Documentation
**************************************

You, the user community, can help update and revise Open edX documentation.

Open edX documentation is published from `RST`_ source files using `Sphinx`_.

To suggest a revision, create a new branch, make changes, and submit
a pull request: this is known as the `GitHub
Flow`_.

Propose Changes While Viewing Documentation
**********************************************

While viewing documentation, you can easily propose a change by selecting **suggest edit** from the menu under the GitHub icon. The page you are viewing then opens in GitHub, in edit mode. When you save your edits, you create a new branch and pull request, to have your changes reviewed by the Open edX team.


Build and Test Documentation
******************************

To build documentation, from the root folder in the command line, enter ``make html``.

Sphinx should build the HTML files locally.

You should ensure the documentation builds with no errors or warnings when submitting a pull request.
