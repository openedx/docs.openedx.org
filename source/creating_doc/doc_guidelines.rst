New Documentation Guidelines
==============================

If you have developed a new feature, created an XBlock, or otherwise see that a topic is missing in this documentation, you can create one or more new pages in this document and submit a pull request to have the content added.  Follow the guidelines below.

When you are ready to update documentation, see :ref:`Quick Start: Add Documentation via Github`.

GitHub
*******

Open edX documentation, along with source code, is managed in GitHub, in the `Open edX Documentation GitHub repository`_.

Anyone can propose updates to the documentation, following a process known as the `GitHub Flow`_.

The Open edX team will review the proposed changes, collaborate with the author, and merge the documentation when it is ready. You will then see it on the `Open edX Documentation`_ site.

RST
***

Open edX documentaiton is written in RST. In this topic, we show the basics of RST, and we provide a :ref:`Documentation Templates` you can copy from to create a new documentation.

We also recommend reviewing the `RST Primer`_ if you have questions.

Audiences
**********

Open edX documentation is organized by the following audiences:

* **Educators**, who build online courses using Studio.

* **Course Operators**, who run online courses, using features in the LMS.

* **Site Operators**, who install and configure Open edX.

* **Developers**, who contribute new features or bug fixes to the core Open edX platform, or develop other components and XBlocks that integrate with the core platform.

When you develop new documentation, you should identify the audience(s) who need the information. Some platform changes may need you to address multiple audiences. For example, a new feature may require instructions for Site Operators to enable it, and for Educators to use it in a course.

Content Types
**************

To keep documentations streamlined and make it easy for users to find answers, we make each topic one of three types:

* **How-to** topics provide direct and easy-to-follow instructions to accomplish specific goals. For example, topics provide the steps to create a new course subsection and to schedule a course.

* **Reference** topics provide details about a function or feature of Open edX. For example there are many details about course subsections such as the different publication states, grading configuration, and visibility that are not included in the how-to topic *Create a Subsection* but are fully described in the reference topic *Course Subsections*.  These two topics are linked in See Also sections.

* **Concept topics** provide best practices or other guidelines for using Open edX. For example, the topics *Crafting Effective Learning Objectives* and *Aligning End-of-Module Assessments to Learning Objectives* are meant to provide guidelines for educators.

When you are creating new documentation, you should identify which type(s) of topics you need to create.

Get Started
************

When you have identified the audience(s) and content type(s) you need to address, we recommend that you follow the steps in :ref:`Quick Start: Add Documentation via Github`.

If you have questions as you go, we recoomend asking the Open edX Documentation Slack channel.
