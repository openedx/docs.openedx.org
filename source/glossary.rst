   AAC
    Advanced audio coding (AAC) is an audio coding standard for digital audio
    compression. AAC is the standard format for YouTube.

   A/B test
      See :ref:`Manage Content Experiments`.

   About page
      The course page that provides potential learners with a course summary,
      prerequisites, a course video and image, and important dates.

   Accessible Label
      In a problem component, you use special formatting to identify the specific
      question that learners will answer by selecting options or entering text or
      numeric responses.

      This text is referred to as the accessible label because screen readers read
      all of the text that you supply for the problem and then repeat the text that
      is identified with this formatting immediately before reading the answer
      choices for the problem. This text is also used by reporting systems to
      identify each problem.

      All problems require accessible labels.

      For more information, see :term:`Simple Editor`.

   Advanced Editor
      An OLX (open learning XML) editor in a problem component that allows you to
      create and edit any type of problem. For more information, see
      :ref:`Advanced Editor`.

   Amazon Web Services (AWS)
      A third-party file hosting site where course teams can store course assets,
      such as problem files and videos. If videos are posted on both YouTube and
      AWS, the AWS version of the video serves as a backup in case the YouTube
      video does not play.

   Assignment Type
      The category of graded student work, such as homework, exams, and exercises.
      For more information, see :ref:`Grades`.

   CAPA Problem
      A CAPA (computer assisted personalized approach) problem refers to any of
      the problem types that are implemented in the edX platform by the
      ``capa_module`` XBlock. Examples range from text input, drag and drop, and
      math expression input problem types to circuit schematic builder, custom
      JavaScript, and chemical equation problem types.

      Other assessment methods are also available, and implemented using other
      XBlocks. An open response assessment is an example of a non-CAPA problem
      type.

   Certificate
      A document issued to an enrolled learner who successfully completes a course
      with the required passing grade. Not all edX courses offer certificates, and
      not all learners enroll as certificate candidates.

      For information about setting up certificates for your course, see
      :ref:`Manage Course Certificates`.

   Chapter
      See :term:`Section`.

      more information, see :ref:`Chemical Equation`.

   Circuit Schematic Builder Problem
      A problem that allows learners to construct a schematic answer (such as an
      electronics circuit) on an interactive grid. For more information, see
      :ref:`Circuit Schematic Builder`.

   Closed Captions
      The spoken part of the transcript for a video file, which is overlaid on the
      video as it plays. To show or hide closed captions, you select the CC
      icon. You can move closed captions to different areas on the video screen by
      dragging and dropping them.

      For more information, see :ref:`Manage Video Transcripts`.

   Codec
      A portmanteau of "code" and "decode". A computer program that can encode or
      decode a data stream.

   Cohort
      A group of learners who participate in a class together. Learners who are in
      the same cohort can communicate and share experiences in private
      discussions.

      Cohorts are an optional feature of courses on the edX platform. For
      information about how you enable the cohort feature, set up cohorts, and
      assign learners to them, see :ref:`About Learner Cohorts`.

   Component
      The part of a unit that contains your actual course content. A unit can
      contain one or more components. For more information, see
      :ref:`Components and Activities TOC`.

   Content Experiment
      You can define alternative course content to be delivered to different,
      randomly assigned groups of learners. Also known as A/B or split testing,
      you use content experiments to compare the performance of learners who have
      been exposed to different versions of the content. For more information, see
      :ref:`About Content Experiments`.

   Content Library
      See :term:`Library`.

   Content-Specific Discussion Topic
      A category within the course discussion that appears at a defined point in
      the course to encourage questions and conversations. To add a content-
      specific discussion topic to your course, you add a discussion component to
      a unit. Learners cannot contribute to a content-specific discussion topic
      until the release date of the section that contains it. Content-specific
      discussion topics can be divided by cohort, so that learners only see and
      respond to posts and responses by other members of the cohort that they are
      in.

      For more information, see :ref:`Configure Open edX Discussions Legacy`. For information about making content-specific discussion topics
      divided by cohort, see :ref:`Set up Discussions in Cohorted Courses`.    

   Course Catalog
      The page that lists all courses offered in the your Open edX learning management system.

      Course handouts are files you make available to learners on the Home
      page. For more information, see :ref:`Add Course Updates and Handouts`.

   Course Mode
      See :term:`enrollment track`.

   Course Navigation Pane
      The navigation frame that appears at one side of the Course page in the
      LMS. The course navigation pane shows the sections in the course. When you
      select a section, the section expands to show subsections. When you select a
      subsection, the first unit in that subsection appears on the course page.

      See also :term:`Unit Navigation Bar`.

   Course Page
      The page that opens first when learners access your course. On the Course
      page, learners can view the course outline and directly access the course,
      either by clicking a specific section or subsection on the outline, or by
      clicking the Start Course button (Resume Course if the learner has
      previously accessed the course).

      The latest course update, such as a course welcome message, appears above the
      course outline. Links to various Course Tools including Bookmarks,
      Reviews and Updates appear at the side of this page. This page is a
      combination of the former Home and Courseware pages.

   Course Run
      A version of the course that runs at a particular time. Information about a
      course run includes start and end dates, as well as staff and the languages
      the course is available in. You can create a course run when you create a
      course. Course run information changes every time the course runs.

   Course Track
      See :term:`enrollment track`.

   Courseware
      In :term:`OLX` and in data packages, "courseware" refers to the
      main content of your course, consisting mainly of lessons and assessments.
      Courseware is organized into sections, subsections, units, and components.
      Courseware does not include handouts, the syllabus, or other course
      materials.

      Note that the Course page was formerly called the Courseware page.

   Course-Wide Discussion Topic
      Optional discussion categories that you create to guide how learners find
      and share information in the course discussion. Course-wide discussion
      topics are accessed from the Discussion page in your course. Examples of
      course-wide discussion topics include Announcements and Frequently Asked
      Questions. Learners can contribute to these topics as soon as your course
      starts. For more information, see :ref:`About Course Discussions` and
      :ref:`Create CourseWide Discussion Topics`.

      If you use cohorts in your course, you can divide course-wide discussion
      topics by cohort, so that although all learners see the same topics, they
      only see and respond to posts and responses by other members of the cohort
      that they are in. For information about configuring discussion topics in
      courses that use cohorts, see :ref:`Set up Discussions in Cohorted Courses`.

   Custom Response Problem
      A custom response problem evaluates text responses from learners using an
      embedded Python script. These problems are also called
      "write-your-own-grader" problems. For more information, see
      :ref:`About Custom Python-Evaluated Input Problem`.

   Data Czar
      A data czar is the single representative at a partner institution who is
      responsible for receiving course data from edX, and transferring it securely
      to researchers and other interested parties after it is received.

   Discussion
      The set of topics defined to promote course-wide or unit-specific dialog.
      Learners use the discussion topics to communicate with each other and the
      course team in threaded exchanges. For more information, see
      :ref:`About Course Discussions`.

   Discussion Component
      Discussion topics that course teams add directly to units. For example, a
      video component can be followed by a discussion component so that learners
      can discuss the video content without having to leave the page. When you add
      a discussion component to a unit, you create a content-specific discussion
      topic. See also :term:`Content-Specific Discussion Topic`.

      For more information, see :ref:`Configure Open edX Discussions Legacy`.

   Discussion Thread List
      The navigation frame that appears at one side of the Discussion page in
      the LMS. The discussion thread list shows the discussion categories and
      subcategories in the course. When you select a category, the list shows all
      of the posts in that category. When you select a subcategory, the list shows
      all of the posts in that subcategory. Select a post to read it and its
      responses and comments, if any.

   Dropdown Problem
      A problem that asks learners to choose from a collection of answer options,
      presented as a drop-down list. For more information, see
      :ref:`Dropdown`.

   Enrollment Mode
      See :term:`enrollment track`.

   Enrollment Track
      Also called certificate type, course mode, course seat, course
      track, course type, enrollment mode, or seat type.

      The enrollment track specifies the following items about a course.

        * The type of certificate, if any, that learners receive if they pass the
          course.
        * Whether learners must verify their identity to earn a certificate, using
          a webcam and a photo ID.
        * Whether the course requires a fee.

      * audit: This is the default enrollment track when learners enroll in a
        course. This track does not offer certificates, does not require identity
        verification, and does not require a course fee.

      * professional: This enrollment track is only used for specific
        professional education courses. The professional enrollment track offers
        certificates, requires identity verification, and requires a fee. Fees for
        the professional enrollment track are generally higher than fees for the
        verified enrollment track. Courses that offer the professional track do not
        offer a free enrollment track.

      * verified: This enrollment track offers verified certificates to
        learners who pass the course, verify their identities, and pay a required
        course fee. A course that offers the verified enrollment track also
        automatically offers a free non-certificate enrollment track.

      * honor: This enrollment track was offered in the past and offered an
        honor code certificate to learners who pass the course. This track does not
        require identity verification and does not require a fee. 

      * professional (no ID): Like the professional enrollment track, this
        track offers certificates and requires a fee. However, this track does
        not require identity verification. Courses that offer the professional
        (no ID) track do not offer a free enrollment track.

   Exercises
