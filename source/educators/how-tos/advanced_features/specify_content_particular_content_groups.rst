Specify Content as Available Only to Particular Content Groups

.. tags:: educator, how-to

In Studio, you can modify the settings of units or components to give access
only to learners who are in cohorts associated with particular content groups.
You cannot specify entire subsections or sections for restricted access by
particular content groups.

You do not need to edit the access settings of units or components that are
intended for all learners. Units or components that you do not restrict access
to are available to all learners enrolled in your course, regardless of the
cohort that they belong to.

.. note:: If a unit has group access restrictions set, all of its child
   components inherit these group access restrictions unless you explicitly
   set different group access restrictions for individual child components.

For details about how to modify unit access settings, see :ref:`Set Access
Restrictions For a Unit`.

For details about how to modify component access settings, see :ref:`Set Access
Restrictions For a Component`.

For details about previewing your course to ensure that learners in a cohort
correctly see the content intended for them, see :ref:`View Usage of a Content
Group` and :ref:`Viewing Cohort Specific Courseware`.

.. note:: In addition to access settings for content groups, a learner's
   ability to see a course component also depends on whether it is marked as
   visible to staff only, whether the unit is published, and the course's
   release date. For details about testing course content in general, see
   :ref:`Testing Your Course Content`.
