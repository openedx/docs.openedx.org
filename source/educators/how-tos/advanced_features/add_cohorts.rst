.. tags:: educator, how-to

After you :ref:`enable the cohorts<Enable Cohorts>` feature for your course, you can add cohorts. To
add a cohort to your course, follow these steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. Click **Add Cohort**.

#. Enter a name for the cohort.

   .. note::
    Learners can see the name of the cohort they are assigned to. The message
    "This post is visible only to {cohort name}" appears with each post in
    discussion topics that are divided by cohort. See :ref:`Read the Group
    Indicator in Posts`.

#. Specify whether learners are automatically or manually assigned to this
   cohort.

#. Optionally, select **Select a Content Group** to associate the cohort with a
   :ref:`content group<About Content Groups>`. For information about creating
   cohort-specific course content by associating cohorts with content groups,
   see :ref:`Cohorts Overview` and :ref:`Offering Differentiated Content`.

#. Select **Save**.

Continue implementing your cohort strategy by creating additional cohorts as
applicable, and specifying the assignment method for each cohort.

.. note:: By the time your course starts, you must have at least one cohort in
   your course that is automatically assigned. If you have not created at
   least one automated assignment cohort in the course by the time that the
   first learner accesses your course content or a divided discussion topic,
   the platform creates a default cohort in your course to which learners are automatically assigned.

For details about adding learners to a cohort by uploading a .csv file, see
:ref:`Assign Learners to Cohort Groups by uploading CSV`.

For a report that includes the cohort assignment for every enrolled
learner, review the learner profile information for your course. See
:ref:`View and download student data`.

.. note:: You cannot delete cohorts, but you can change their names or the way
   in which learners are assigned to them. If you need to make changes to the
   way you have configured cohorts while your course is running, see
   :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.
