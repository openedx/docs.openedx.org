Remove a Learner from a Team
############################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

Course team members who have the **Staff**, **Admin**, **Discussion Admin**,
or **Discussion Moderator** role can remove members from a team. **Community
TAs** can also remove learners from a team. You might want to remove a learner
from a team and make the spot on the team available to other learners if, for
example, a learner joined a team but is not participating, or if a learner has
unenrolled from the course without leaving the team.

For instructor-managed team-sets, you can also remove learners from teams using
the CSV upload tool. See :ref:`Managing Teams via CSV Upload`

.. note:: Before making significant changes to a team, communicate with team
   members so that they are aware of the changes you will make, and their
   impacts.

To remove a learner from a team, follow these steps.

#. In the LMS, select the **Teams** tab.
#. On the **Teams** page, select **Browse** to show all team-sets.
#. Select the arrow button for the team-set to show all teams in that team-set.
#. Locate the team that you want to edit. To find the team, you can search
   using keywords or sort teams by last activity or open slots.
#. Select **View** for the team from which you want to remove a learner.
#. Select **Edit Team**.
#. On the **Instructor Tools** bar, select **Edit Membership**.

       Team page.

#. On the team's **Membership** page, select **Remove** next to the name of
   the learner who you want to remove from the team.
#. In the confirmation message, select **Remove**.


   The team member you removed no longer appears on the **Membership** page.

#. Repeat steps 8 and 9 to remove additional members.

   The team members you removed no longer appear on the **Membership** page,
   and the count of team members is updated wherever it appears on team pages.
