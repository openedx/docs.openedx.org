Changing the Assignment Method of a Cohort
###########################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

Although you can change the assignment method of a cohort at any time after you
create it, you should have a strategy in mind as you design your course, and
only make changes to cohorts while the course is running if absolutely
necessary. Be aware of the implications of changing cohort configuration while
your course is running. For more information, see :ref:`Options for Assigning
Learners to Cohorts` and :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. note:: When your course starts, you must have at least one cohort in your
   course that has automatic assignment. If you have not created at least one
   automated assignment cohort in the course by the time that the first learner
   accesses your course content, a default cohort to which learners
   are automatically assigned will be created in your course. If the :ref:`default group<Default Cohort
   Group>` is the only automated assignment cohort in your course, you cannot
   change its assignment method to **Manual**.

To change the assignment method of a cohort, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio select **View
   Live**.

#. Select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. From the **Select a cohort** list, select the cohort whose assignment method
   you want to change.

#. On the **Settings** tab, the current assignment method is selected. Change
   the assignment method by selecting the other option, either **Automatic** or
   **Manual**.

#. Select **Save**.

   The cohort assignment method is updated.

.. note:: Changing the cohort assignment method has no effect on learners who
   are already assigned to this and other cohorts. Learners who access the
   course after you make this change are assigned to cohorts based on the new
   assignment method of this cohort combined with the assignment methods of all
   other cohorts.
