   :ref:`View Usage of a Content Group`.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, then select **Group Configurations**.

#. On the **Group Configurations** page, locate the content group that you want
   to delete.

#. Move your cursor over the content group's box, then select the **Delete**
   icon.

#. In the confirmation message, select **Delete** again to confirm the
   deletion.
