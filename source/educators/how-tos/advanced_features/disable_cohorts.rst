.. _Disabling the Cohort Feature:

Disable Cohorts in Your Course
###############################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

.. warning:: Be very careful in deciding to disable the cohort feature if you
   previously had it enabled in a live course, because doing so affects the
   course experience for learners. Course materials and discussion posts that
   were shared only with members of particular cohorts are now visible to all
   learners in the course.

   If you must make changes to the way you have configured cohorts while your
   course is running, be sure you understand the consequences of doing so. For
   details, see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

To disable cohorts in your course, follow these steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. Clear the **Enable Cohorts** option.

All course content and discussion posts that were previously divided by cohort
immediately become visible to all students.

.. _Deleting a Cohort:

Delete a Cohort
*****************

You cannot delete cohorts. However, you can :ref:`rename a cohort<Renaming a
Cohort>`, :ref:`change its assignment method<Changing the Assignment Method of
a Cohort>`, or move learners to other cohorts.

If you decide that you must alter cohort configuration after your course starts
and learners begin viewing the course and the discussion topics, be sure that
you understand the consequences of these actions. For more details, see
:ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.
