   The content experiment includes a container for each group that is defined
   in the group configuration you selected. You create content for each
   experiment group as you do any other component. For more information, see
   :ref:`Developing Course Components`.

#. Select either **Select a Group Configuration** or **Edit** to open the
   content experiment component.

#. For **Group Configuration**, select a group configuration.

#. In the **Display Name** field, enter the name of the component. The display
   name is only used in Studio; learners do not see this value.

#. Select **Save**.

The content experiment is displayed as a component that contains other
components. For more information, see :ref:`Components that Contain Other
Components`.

You can now create content for the groups in the experiment.

   Do not create new content experiments by duplicating configured content
   experiments. Duplicating content experiments after you have configured them
   is not supported.
