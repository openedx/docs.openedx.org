Before you add content experiments to your course, ensure that you have
completed the following tasks.

* :ref:`Configure Your Course for Content Experiments`

#. After you select a group configuration in the content experiment component,
select **View**.

#. The content experiment page that opens automatically includes a container for
each group that is defined in the group configuration you selected. For
example, if you select a group configuration that defines two groups, Group A
and Group B, you see the following page.

#. You add content for both groups as needed, just as you would add content to
any container page. For more information, see :ref:`Components that Contain
Other Components`.

For example, you can add a Text component and a video to Group A.

.. note::   It is valid, and can be useful, to have no content for a group in
   a content experiment. For example, if one group has a video and another
   group has no content, you can analyze the effect of the video on learner
   performance.
