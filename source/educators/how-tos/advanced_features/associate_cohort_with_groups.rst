Associate Cohorts with Content Groups
########################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

After you :ref:`create a content group<Creating Content Groups>`, you can associate it with one or more cohorts
with which you want to share the same special content.

.. note:: A content group can be associated with more than one cohort; a cohort
   cannot be associated with more than one content group.

To associate a cohort with a content group, follow these steps:

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. From the cohorts drop down list, select the cohort to which you want to
   associate your content group.

#. Select the **Settings** tab for the selected cohort.

#. Under **Associated Content Group**, choose the **Select a Content Group**
   option.

#. From the content group drop down list, select the content group that you
   want your cohort to be associated with.

#. Select **Save**.

   You have now associated your content group with a cohort. Any course content
   that you :ref:`designate as available to that content group<Specify Content
   as Available Only to Certain Content Groups>` is available to learners in the
   associated cohort or cohorts.

You can associate additional cohorts with the same or a different content group
by repeating steps 3 to 7.

For an example of using content groups to create cohort-specific course
content, see :ref:`Cohorted Courseware Example`.
