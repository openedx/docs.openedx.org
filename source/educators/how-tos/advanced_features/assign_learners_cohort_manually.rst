Assign Learners to Cohorts Manually
####################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

If you have implemented a manual assignment strategy for cohorts in your
course, make sure your manual assignments are as complete as possible before
your course starts. If learners enroll after your course starts, you should
assign new learners to cohorts as soon as possible.

.. note:: Making changes to cohort assignments after the course starts can
   affect the course experience for learners. Learners might no longer have
   access to course and discussion topics that were previously visible to
   them. For more information, see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

To manually assign learners to cohorts in your course, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio click **View
   Live**.

#. Select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. Scroll to the **Cohort Management** section at the bottom.

#. From the **Select a cohort** list, select the cohort to which you want to
   manually assign learners.

#. On the **Manage Learners** tab, under **Add learners to this cohort** enter
   the username or email address of a single learner, or enter multiple
   usernames or addresses separated by commas or new lines. You can copy data
   from a .csv file of email addresses or usernames, and paste it into this
   field.

#. Select **Add Learners**.

   Learners you added with accounts in your Open edX instance are assigned to the selected
   cohorts. A confirmation message indicates the number of learners who were
   successfully added to the cohort.

   Learners you added who do not yet have accounts in your Open edX instance are listed as
   "Preassigned" to the cohort. When preassigned learners enroll in the
   course, they are automatically added to the cohort.

   If some learners that you listed could not be added to cohorts, an error
   message lists the email addresses or usernames of learners who could not be
   added to the cohort.

.. note:: Because learners can belong to only one cohort, adding a learner to a
   cohort moves them from any cohort they were previously assigned to. The
   confirmation message indicates the number of learners who were moved from
   their previous cohort assignment as a result of your adding them to the
   current cohort.

For a report that includes cohort assignments for your course, review the
learner profile information for your course. See :ref:`View and download
student data`.
