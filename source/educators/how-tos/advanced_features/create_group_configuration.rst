You can create a group configuration at any time and used to creat :ref: content experiments in your courses <Configure Your Course for Content Experiments>

#. On the **Group Configurations** page, under **Experiment Groups**, select
   **New Experiment Group**. The following page opens:

    :width: 800
    :align: center
    :alt: An image of the Create a New Group Configuration page in Studio.

#. Enter a name in the **Group Configuration Name** field. Use a meaningful
   name, because you will select from group configuration names when you create
   content experiments. Learners do not see the group configuration name.

#. Optionally, enter a description for the new group configuration.

#. By default, a new configuration already contains two groups. Modify the
   groups or add and delete groups as needed. A group configuration must have
   at least one group.

   * Modify group names as needed. You see group names in the unit page in
     Studio, but group names are not visible to learners.
   * Select **Add another group** to include another group as part of the
     configuration.
   * Select the **X** to the right of an existing group to remove it from the
     configuration. A group configuration must have at least one group.

#. Select **Create** to save the new group configuration.

The group configuration is then listed in the page. You can see the number of
groups that the configuration contains, as well as whether the configuration is
in use in the course:
