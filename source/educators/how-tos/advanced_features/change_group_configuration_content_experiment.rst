Change the Group Configuration for a Content Experiment
#######################################################

You can change the group configuration for a content experiment. When you
change the group configuration, you edit the content for any additional groups
in the group configuration. You can use the components from the previous
groups, as well as create new components.

.. warning::   Changing the group configuration of a learner-visible content
   experiment will affect the experiment data.

#. Open the unit that contains the content experiment.

#. In the content experiment component, select **Edit**.

#. Select a different group configuration.

#. Select **Save**.

#. You must now add components to the new groups in the experiment. Select
   **View** to open the content experiment.

   You see that groups for the new configuration are empty, and any components
   that you had added to groups in the previous configuration are now moved to
   a section called **Inactive Groups**.
