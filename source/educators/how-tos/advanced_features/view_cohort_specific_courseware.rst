After you restrict access to units or components to particular content groups,
you can view your course content as a member of a content group to ensure that
members of each group correctly see the content intended for them.

.. note:: In addition to access settings for content groups, a learner's
   ability to see a unit or component also depends on whether it is marked as
   visible to staff only, whether the unit is published, and the component's
   release date. For details about viewing course content in various publishing
   states, see :ref:`View Published Content` and :ref:`Preview Unpublished
   Content`.

Depending on whether you want to view published content or unpublished content,
you choose either **View Live** or **Preview** from the course outline in
Studio. You can then experience the course content as a learner in a particular
group would, by selecting the **View this course as** option for a learner in
the desired content group, as described in :ref:`Roles for Viewing Course
Content`.

For details about testing course content, see :ref:`Testing Your Course
Content`.
