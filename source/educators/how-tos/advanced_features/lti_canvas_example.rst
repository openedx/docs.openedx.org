.. warning:: This feature was a closed pilot experiment. This feature is poorly documented and may not work properly.

To use Open edX course content in the Canvas LMS, you add a new app to the course and then add external tool module items.

.. note:: This example relies on the use of a third-party tool. Because this
  tool is subject to change by its owner, the steps and illustrations provided
  here are intended as guidelines and not as exact procedures.

#. In Canvas, select your course. In **Settings**, select **Add New App**.

#. In **Modules**, add a new **External Tool** item. The **URL** is the LTI
   URL that you determined for the your course content.
