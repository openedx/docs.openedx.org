Create a Team

.. tags:: educator, how-to

Although learners in your course may be able create their own teams in open
team-sets, you can seed open team-sets with a few teams to give learners some
ideas for their own teams.

For instructor-managed team-sets, you can also create teams in bulk, using the
CSV upload tool. See :ref:`Managing Teams via CSV Upload`

Course team members who have the **Staff**, **Admin**, **Discussion Admin**,
or **Discussion Moderator** role can create new teams within team-sets.
**Community TAs** and learners in the course can also create teams, although
learners can create a new team only in open team-sets and only if they do not
already belong to a team in that team-set.

To create a team, follow these steps.

#. From the **Teams** page in the LMS, select **Browse**, then select the
   team-set in which you want to create a team.

#. At the bottom of the list of teams within the team-set, select the **create
   a new team in this team-set** link.

3. On the **Create a New Team** page, add a name and description for the team.

   In the description, include details about the proposed project or activity
   to help learners to decide whether they want to join this team.

#. Optionally, add some characteristics for your team. You can specify a
   language that members would primarily use to communicate with each other,
   and a country that members would primarily identify with. Keep in mind that
   if your team details make the team membership seem too selective, learners
   might be discouraged from joining.

#. When you have finished entering details for the team, select **Create**.

   Your new team is added to the list of teams under your selected team-set.
