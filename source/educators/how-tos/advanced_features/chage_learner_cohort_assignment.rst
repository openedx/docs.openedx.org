.. _Changing Student Cohort Assignments:

Change Learner Cohort Assignments
##################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

After your course starts and learners begin to contribute to the course
discussion, each post that they add is visible either to everyone or to the
members of a single cohort. When you change the cohort that a learner is
assigned to, the following occur:

* The learner continues to see the posts that are visible to everyone.

* The learner now sees the posts that are visible to their new cohort.

* The learner no longer sees the posts that are visible only to their original
  cohort.

The visibility of a post and its responses and comments does not change, even
if the cohort assignment of its author changes. To a learner, it can seem that
posts have "disappeared".

To verify the cohort assignments for your learners, download the :ref:`student
profile report<View and download student data>` for your course. If changes are
needed, you can :ref:`assign learners<Assign Learners to Cohorts Manually>` to
different cohorts manually in the LMS by selecting **Instructor** and then
**Cohorts**, or :ref:`upload cohort assignment changes<Assign Learners to
Cohort Groups by uploading CSV>` in a .csv file.
