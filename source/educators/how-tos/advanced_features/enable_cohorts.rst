Enabling Cohorts in your Course
#################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

To enable cohorts in your course, follow these steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. Select **Enable Cohorts**.

You can now :ref:`add cohorts<Add Cohorts>` to your course.

.. warning:: Be very careful in deciding to enable the cohort feature in a live
   course, because doing so affects the course experience for learners.
   Learners might no longer have access to course and discussion topics
   that were previously visible to them.

   If you must make changes to cohort configuration while your course is
   running, be sure you understand the consequences of doing so. For details,
   see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.
