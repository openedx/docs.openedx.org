.. tags:: educator, how-to

You can edit certificates before and after they are activated.

Only course team members with the Staff or Admin role can edit activated
certificates.

.. caution::
  As a best practice, do not make changes to certificates in a running course
  if it is possible that certificates have already been issued to learners,
  because different learners might be awarded certificates with different
  details for the same course.

  If you must edit an activated certificate, you should :ref:`deactivate
  <Deactivate a Certificate>` the certificate before making changes to it.

To edit a certificate, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Settings** menu, select **Certificates**.

#. On the **Certificates** page, at the top of the certificate form, select the
   **Edit** icon.

#. When you have finished editing the certificate, select **Save**.

   After you save your changes, you can :ref:`preview the certificate<Preview
   a Certificate>` to make sure it appears as you want it to. You then need to
   :ref:`activate the certificate<Activate a Certificate>` before certificates
   can be issued.

.. _Specify an Alternative Course Title:

********************************
Specify a Different Course Title
********************************

Optionally, you can specify an alternative course title to use on the
certificate. You might want to use a different title on your course
certificates if, for example, the official course name is too long to fit on
the certificate.

#. In Studio, from the **Settings** menu, select **Certificates**.

#. On the **Certificates** page, at the top of the certificate form, select the
   **Edit** icon.

#. In the **Course Title Override** field, enter the alternative title for your
   course.

#. Select **Save**.

You can also specify an alternative course number. To do this, see `Set a
Course Number Override`_.

.. _Set a Course Number Override:

*********************************
Specify a Different Course Number
*********************************

Optionally, you can specify an alternative course number to use on the
certificate.

You might want to use a different number on your course certificates if, for
example, the official course number is meaningful only within your institution.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, and then **Advanced Settings**.

#. Locate the **Course Number Display String** field. This field contains the
   course number you set to override the official course number on
   certificates.

#. Between quotation marks (``" "``), enter the course number you want
   displayed on certificates.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

   A message lets you know whether your changes were saved successfully.

.. _Specify an Alternative Certificates Available Date:

***********************************************
Specify a Different Certificates Available Date
***********************************************

By default, certificates become available to learners 48 hours after your
course ends. You can also specify a different date to make certificates
available.

#. In Studio, open your course.
#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.
#. In the **Course Schedule** section, enter the date and time when you want to
   issue certificates in the **Certificates Available Date** and **Certificates
   Available Time** fields.

.. _Delete a Certificate:

********************
Delete a Certificate
********************

You can delete a certificate that is not activated.

.. caution::
  Do not delete a certificate after the course has started. A learner who has
  already earned a certificate will no longer be able to access it.

To delete a certificate, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Settings** menu, select **Certificates**.

#. On the **Certificates** page, at the top of the certificate form, select the
   "Delete" icon.
