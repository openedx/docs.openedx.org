After you determine the start and end dates for a course run, and whether you
want your course run to be self-paced or instructor-paced, you specify these
settings on the **Schedule & Details** page in Studio.

For more information about determining how to schedule your course, see
:ref:`Course Schedule <Course Schedule>`.

.. _Set Start and End Dates:

*******************************************
Set Start and End Dates and Times in Studio
*******************************************

To set dates and times for the course and for course enrollment in Studio,
follow these steps.

.. note::
 It is recommended that you verify all important dates in Studio one week before
 you plan to start the course.

#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. In the **Course Schedule** section, replace the placeholder dates and times
   with your own information.

   When you make changes on this page, a panel with options to save or cancel
   your work appears.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

.. note::
  The times that you set are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You might
  want to verify that you have specified the times that you intend by using a
  time zone converter such as `Time and Date Time Zone Converter`_.

.. _Advertise a Different Start Date:

*********************************
Advertise a Different Start Date
*********************************

You can advertise a start date for your course that is different from the
course start date you set in the **Schedule & Details** page. You might want
to do this if the exact start date is uncertain.

You can enter a specific date or a description. For example, you could
advertise the start date as either "15 Oct 2016" or "Anytime, self-paced".

To set an advertised start date in Studio, follow these steps.

#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Advanced Settings**.

#. Locate the **Course Advertised Start Date** field. The default value is
   ``null``.

#. Enter the start date that you want learners to see for your course in
   MM/DD/YYYY format.

   A date value entered in MM/DD/YYYY format appears to learners in DD Mon YYYY
   format. For example, 10/15/2016 appears as 15 Oct 2016.

#. Add quotation marks (``" "``) before and after the start date value. An
   example follows.

   ::

     "Anytime, self-paced"

#. Select **Save Changes**.

   A message lets you know whether your changes were saved successfully.

.. note::
 If you do not change the default course start date (01/01/2030), and the
 **Course Advertised Start Date** policy value is ``null``, no start date
 appears for the course. Learners just see that the course has not yet started.
