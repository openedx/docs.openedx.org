After you determine the start and end dates for a course run, and whether you
want your course run to be self-paced or instructor-paced, you specify these
settings on the **Schedule & Details** page in Studio.

For more information about determining how to schedule your course, see
:ref:`Course Schedule <Course Schedule>`.

.. _Set Start and End Dates:

*******************************************
Set Start and End Dates and Times in Studio
*******************************************

To set dates and times for the course and for course enrollment in Studio,
follow these steps.

.. note::
 It is recommended that you verify all important dates in Studio one week before
 you plan to start the course.

#. With the course open in Studio, from the :guilabel:`Settings` menu, select :guilabel:`Schedule and Details`.

#. For course pacing, select :guilabel:`Instructor-Paced` or :guilabel:`Self-Paced`.

#. Enter date and time information for the course:

   * **Course Start Date** and **Course Start Time**: The date and time that learners can access and begin the course.

   * **Course End Date** and **Course End Time**: The date and time that learners must end the course, and after which they no longer have access.

   * **Enrollment Start Date** and **Enrollment Start Time**: The date and time that learners can begin to enroll in the course. This must be before or the same as the date and time you set the course to start.

   * **Enrollment End Date** and **Enrollment End Time**: The date and time deadline for enrollment. This must be  before or the same as the date and time you set the course to end.

#. At the bottom of the screen, click :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

.. END SET COURSE SCHEDULE

.. note::
  The times that you set are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You might
  want to verify that you have specified the times that you intend by using a
  time zone converter such as `Time and Date Time Zone Converter`_.

.. _Advertise a Different Start Date:

*********************************
Advertise a Different Start Date
*********************************

You can advertise a start date for your course that is different from the
course start date you set in the **Schedule & Details** page. You might want
to do this if the exact start date is uncertain.

You can enter a specific date or a description. For example, you could
advertise the start date as either "15 Oct 2016" or "Anytime, self-paced".

To set an advertised start date in Studio, follow these steps.

#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Advanced Settings**.

#. Locate the **Course Advertised Start Date** field. The default value is
   ``null``.

#. Enter the start date that you want learners to see for your course in
   MM/DD/YYYY format.

   A date value entered in MM/DD/YYYY format appears to learners in DD Mon YYYY
   format. For example, 10/15/2016 appears as 15 Oct 2016.

#. Add quotation marks (``" "``) before and after the start date value. An
   example follows.

   ::

     "Anytime, self-paced"

#. Select **Save Changes**.

   A message lets you know whether your changes were saved successfully.

.. note::
 If you do not change the default course start date (01/01/2030), and the
 **Course Advertised Start Date** policy value is ``null``, no start date
 appears for the course. Learners just see that the course has not yet started.
