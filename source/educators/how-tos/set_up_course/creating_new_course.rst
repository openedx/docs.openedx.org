Creating a New Course in Studio

This topic describes how to use Studio to create and set up a course.

To create and run a course, you can either create an entirely new course in
Studio, or you can re-run an existing course. For more information about re-
running a course, see :ref:`Rerun a Course <Rerun a Course>`.

You can also :ref:`export<Export a Course>` and :ref:`import<Import a Course>`
courses as XML files. You can do this when you need to back up a course or edit
the course in XML.

To create a course, follow these steps.

#. Sign in to Studio.

#. Select **New Course**.

#. Enter the following information about your course.

   .. important::
    The values that you enter for the organization, course number, and course
    run cannot be edited after you create your course.

   * For **Course Name**, enter the title of your course. For example, the
     name might be "Sets, Maps, and Symmetry Groups". Use title capitalization
     for the course title, and normal spacing and punctuation.

   * For **Organization**, you enter the identifier for your organization. Do
     not include spaces or special characters.

   * For **Course Number**, you enter both a subject abbreviation and a number.
     For example, for public health course number 207, enter ``PH207``. For
     math course 101x, enter ``Math101x``. Do not include spaces or special
     characters in the course number.

     .. note:: If your course will be public, be sure to include the "x".
        If it is exclusively an on campus offering, do not include the "x".

   * For **Course Run**, you enter the term in which your course will run. For
     example, enter 2014SOND or T2_2014. Do not include spaces or special
     characters.

     The value that you enter for the run does not affect the course start date
     that you define for the course. For more information, see :ref:`Scheduling
     Your Course <Scheduling
     Your Course>`.

   The organization, course number, and course run values that you enter are
   used to create the URL for your course. Because URLs do not have an
   unlimited length, the total number of characters that you enter for these
   values must be 65 or fewer.

#. Select **Create**.

   The :ref:`Course Outline<Developing Your Course Outline>` page opens. You
   can start developing course content. For more information, see
   :ref:`Getting Started with Course Content Development <Getting Started with Course Content Development>`.
