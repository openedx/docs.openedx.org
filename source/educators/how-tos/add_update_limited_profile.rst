A limited profile includes only your username and, optionally, an image.

.. note:: If you are under 13 years of age, your limited profile only includes
   your username. You cannot add a profile picture.

To add or update a limited profile, follow these steps.


#. At the top of any page, select **Dashboard** from the dropdown menu icon next
   to your username, then select the **Profile** tab.

#. In the header area of your profile page, for **Profile Visibility**, select
   **Limited Profile**.

#. (optional) Add an image that you want to associate with your username.
   Your image must be a .gif, .jpg, or .png file. The image must be between
   100 bytes and 1 MB in size. If you do not add an image, the placeholder
   image appears as your profile image.

   #. Move your cursor over the placeholder image, and click **Upload an
      image**.

   #. In the file navigation window, select the image file that you want to
      use as your profile image, and then click **Open**.

   To change or remove your profile image, move your cursor over your image,
   and then select either **Change image** or **Remove**. When you remove your
   profile image, the placeholder image appears as your profile image.

The site saves your changes automatically.
