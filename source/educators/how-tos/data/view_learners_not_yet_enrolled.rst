View Learners Not Yet Enrolled
#################################

After you enroll learners in a course using the **Auto Enroll** option, any
learner who does not yet have a user account must register and activate an
account to complete the enrollment process. In addition, the learner must
register the account using the same email address that was used for auto
enrollment. You can download a report of auto enrolled email addresses that do
not yet correspond to an enrolled learner.

To download this report, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Data Download**.

#. In the **Reports** section of the page, select **Download a CSV of learners
   who can enroll**.

  A status message indicates that report generation is in progress. This
  process can take some time to complete, but you can navigate away from this
  page and do other work while it runs.

  To track the progress of the report process, reload the page in your browser
  and scroll down to the **Pending Tasks** section.

4. To open or save the report, select the
   ``{org}_{course_id}_may_enroll_info_{date}.csv`` file name at the bottom of
   the page.
