You can review information about how grading is configured for your course, and
access learner grades, at any time after you create the course. You can also
make adjustments to learner grading for a problem, for a single learner or all
learners. For information about the grading data that you can access and the
changes you can make, see the following topics.

 :depth: 1

To review learner answers to course problems, you can check the answer
submissions for a specific problem, either for a selected learner or for all
learners. You can also review answer distribution data for all of the problems.
See :ref:`Review_Answers`.

For open response assessments, you can generate an ORA data report that
provides details of each learner's response and of assessments that were
performed on each response. For details, see :ref:`Generate ORA Report`.

For information about how you establish a grading policy and work with the
Problem components in your course, see :ref:`Grading Index` or
:ref:`Working with Problem Components`.

************************************************
Review How Grading Is Configured for Your Course
************************************************

You can review the assignment types that are graded and their respective
weights in the LMS by selecting **Instructor** to access the instructor
dashboard.

You establish a grading policy for your course when you create it in Studio.
While the course is running, you can view an XML representation of the
assignment types in your course and how they are weighted to determine
learners' grades.

..  DOC-290: research this statement before including anything like it: Below the list of graded assignment types and their weights, each *public* subsection and unit that contains an assignment is listed.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Data Download** > **Grading
   Configuration**.

   A list of the assignment types in your course displays. In this example,
   Homework is weighted as 0.3 (30%) of the grade.

   .. image:: /_images/educator_how_tos/Grading_Configuration.png
     :alt: XML of course assignment types and weights for grading.

   In Studio, you define this information by selecting **Settings** and then
   **Grading**. For more information, see :ref:`Configure the Assignment
   Types`.

   .. image:: /_images/educator_how_tos/Grading_Configuration_Studio.png
     :alt: Studio example of homework assignment type and grading weight.


.. important:: Any changes that you make to the course grading policy, to graded
   subsections, or to graded components after the course begins will affect
   learners' grades and their experience in the course as well as analysis of
   course data.

   Best practice is that you announce any unavoidable grading related changes to
   learners by using, for example, updates on the **Course** page. You should
   also carefully track such changes for researchers.

.. _Access_grades:

****************************************************
Generate a Grade Report for All Learners in a Course
****************************************************

For any course, you can generate grades and then download a file with the
results for all learners in the course, including unenrolled learners. Best practice is to generate a grade report as soon as certificates have been issued for your course.

When you initiate calculations to grade learner work, a process starts on the
Open edX servers. The complexity of your grading configuration and the number of
learners in your course affect how long this process takes. You can download a
report of the calculated grades in a comma-separated values (.csv) file when
the grading process is complete.

You also have the option to review learner grades on the instructor dashboard.
For more information, see :ref:`gradebook`.

To generate and download the grade report for the learners in your course,
follow these steps.

.. important::
   Because the grade report file contains confidential, personally identifiable
   data, be sure to follow your institution's data stewardship policies when
   you open or save this file.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Data Download**.

#. To start the grading process, select **Generate Grade Report**.

   A status message indicates that the grading process is in progress. This
   process can take some time to complete, but you can navigate away from this
   page and do other work while it runs.

#. To check the progress of the grading process, reload the page in your
   browser and scroll down to the **Pending Tasks** section. The
   status of active tasks is shown in the table.

   When the report is complete, a linked .csv file name becomes available above
   the **Pending Tasks** section. File names are in the format
   ``{course_id}_grade_report_{datetime}.csv``. The most recently generated
   reports appear at the top of the list.

#. To open or save a grade report file, locate and select the link for the
   grade report you requested.

   You can open .csv files in a spreadsheet application to sort, graph, and
   compare data.

.. note::
   To prevent the accidental distribution of learner data, you can download
   grade report files only by selecting the links on this page. Do not copy
   these links for reuse elsewhere, as they expire within 5 minutes. The links
   on this page also expire if the page is open for more than 5 minutes. If

************************************************************
Generate a Problem Grade Report for All Learners in a Course
************************************************************

For any course, you can calculate grades for problems and generate a report
that can be downloaded. The problem grade report for a course shows the number
of points that each learner has earned for each problem, and the number of
possible points for every problem in the course. In addition, the
report shows the final grade score for each learner.

To generate and download the problem grade report for all learners who have
ever enrolled in your course, follow these steps.

  specific graded subsection. For information about how to do this, see
  :ref:`Override in Gradebook`.


.. _Override Subsection Bulk:

******************************************
Override Learner Subsection Scores in Bulk
******************************************

.. note:: Master’s-only feature

This feature is available in courses with a Master’s track, to support bulk grade adjustments or curving. It allows you to override subsection (i.e. assignment or exam) grades for in bulk by uploading a file.

.. note:: Grade overrides apply to all learners enrolled in supported courses. There is a size limit of 4MB (~10k learners) for uploaded files. If your Master’s track course is bigger than this, you’ll have to upload grading files in chunks.

To override grades in bulk, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Student Admin**.

#. Select **View Gradebook**.

#. Set up the filters to identify the segment of learners you want to grade.

#. Click the **Download Grades** button to download a CSV of subsection assignment grades for learners matching the currently specified filters.

   The CSV contains one row per learner, and the following columns:

   * **username**: The user's username
   * **student_key**: The user's external university ID, if configured
   * **course_id**: The course ID
   * **track**: The user's enrollment track (e.g. audit, verified, etc.)
   * **cohort**: The user's assigned cohort, if any

   In addition, there are five columns per graded subsection. **<id>** is a unique internal identifier for each graded subsection.

   * **name-<id>**: The name of the subsection
   * **grade-<id>**: The “effective” grade for the subsection. This is equal to the override grade if there is an override, otherwise it is equal to the “original grade”
   * **original_grade-<id>**: The grade that the user earned through answering problems and being scored through the LMS
   * **previous_override-<id>**: The overridden grade (if any) that the learner has received through gradebook grade overrides
   * **new_override-<id>**: This column will always be blank. This is where you will enter the user's new grade for the subsection

#. Fill in the points to award in the new_override column for the assignment(s) you want to override grades for and save the file.

#. Return to the Gradebook and click the **Import Grades** button.

#. Select your updated grades file and click **Open**.

#. The Gradebook will process your file, update learner grades, and provide a summary of grades updated and any errors.

.. _delete_state:

=======================================
Delete a Learner's State for a Problem
=======================================

You can completely delete a learner's database history, or "state", for a
problem. You can only delete learner state for one learner at a time.

For example, you realize that a problem needs to be rewritten after only a few
of your learners have answered it. To resolve this situation, you rewrite the
problem and then delete learner state only for the affected learners so that
they can try again.

To delete a learner's entire history for a problem from the database, you need
that learner's username or email address.

.. important:: Learner state is deleted permanently by this process. This
   action cannot be undone.

   When you delete a learner's state for an open response assessment (ORA)
   problem, the learner will have to start the assignment from the beginning,
   including submitting responses and going through the required assessment
   steps.

You can use either the **Staff Debug Info** option or the instructor dashboard
to delete learner state.

Find the Unique Location Identifier for a Problem
==================================================

When you create each of the problems for a course, the platform assigns a unique
location to it. To make grading adjustments for a problem, or to view data
about it, you need to specify the problem location.

Location identifiers for problems can be in one of these formats.

* ``location = block-v1:{org}+{course}+{run}+type@problem+block@{id}``, for
  example, ``location = block-v1:edX+BlendedX+1T2015+type@problem+block@72e0f73cdf5c4d648ebec0022854f18b``

* ``location = i4x://{org}/{course}/problem/{id}``, for example,
  ``location = i4x://edX/edX101/problem/680cc746e8ee473490841334f0235635``

Courses created since Fall 2014 typically have usage IDs in the first format,
while older courses have usage IDs in the second format.

To find the unique location identifier for a problem, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Course**, and then navigate to the unit that contains the
   problem.

#. Display the problem, and find the **Submission History** and **Staff Debug
   Info** options that appear below it.

#. Select **Staff Debug Info**. Information about the problem appears,
   including its **location**.

#. To copy the location of the problem, select the entire value after
   ``location =``, right click, and then select **Copy**.

To close the Staff Debug viewer, click on the browser page outside of the
viewer.
