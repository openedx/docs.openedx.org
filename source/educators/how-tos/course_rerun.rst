Re-Run a Course

.. tags:: educator, how-to

.. note::
  After the end date for a course has passed, the course moves to the
  **Archived Courses** tab on the Studio dashboard. If the course that you want
  to re-run is not visible on the **Courses** tab, look for the course on the
  **Archived Courses** tab.

To re-run a course, the course team can :ref:`use the course Import and Export
options <Export-Import the Course>`, or a system administrator
can :ref:`use the Re-Run Course option <Use Re-Run to Create a Course>`. Note
that the **Import** and **Export** method takes less time than the **Course
Re-Run** option because this method does not require action from a system
administrator.

.. _Export-Import the Course:

.. note:: Before you re-run a course, make sure that its settings and content
  are complete. Additions and changes that you make to the original course
  after you create the new course have no effect on the new course.

Only global or system administrators have the permissions needed to re-run
a course. To re-run a course, contact your system administrator. After your
system administrator creates a new course using the re-run feature, you can
complete the steps to :ref:`update the new course<Update the New Course>`.

To re-run a course, users who have the required permissions follow these
steps.

#. Sign in to Studio. Your dashboard lists the courses that you have access to as a course team member.

#. Move your cursor over each row in the list of courses. The **Re-Run Course** and **View Live** options appear for each course.

#. Locate the course you want to re-run and select **Re-Run Course**. The **Create a re-run of a course** page opens with values already supplied in the **Course Name**, **Organization**, and **Course Number** fields.

#. In the **Course Run** field, indicate when the new course will be offered.

  Together, the course number, the organization, and the course run are used
  to create the URL for the new course. The combination of these three
  values must be unique for the new course. In addition, the total number of
  characters used for the name, organization, number, and run must be 65 or
  fewer.

#. Select **Create Re-Run**. Your **My Courses** dashboard opens with a status message about the course creation process.

  Duplication of the course structure and content takes several minutes. You
  can work in other parts of Studio or in the LMS, or on other web sites,
  while the process runs. The new course appears on your **My Courses**
  dashboard in Studio when configuration is complete.
