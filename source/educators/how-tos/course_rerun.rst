Re-Run a Course

.. note::
  After the end date for a course has passed, the course moves to the
  **Archived Courses** tab on the Studio dashboard. If the course that you want
  to re-run is not visible on the **Courses** tab, look for the course on the
  **Archived Courses** tab.

To re-run a course, the course team can :ref:`use the course Import and Export
options <Export-Import the Course>`, or a system administrator
can :ref:`use the Re-Run Course option <Use Re-Run to Create a Course>`. Note
that the **Import** and **Export** method takes less time than the **Course
Re-Run** option because this method does not require action from a system
administrator.
