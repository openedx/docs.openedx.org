#. A notification will appear in the bottom right-hand side of the screen
   indicating the copy is complete. It should only take a few seconds, depending
   on the size of the unit.

#. Navigate to the subsection (in the course outline) where you'd like to paste
   the unit. This may be in the same course or a different course.
