Set the Display Name for a Component
************************************

The display name identifies the component. This name appears as a heading
above the component in the LMS, and it identifies the component for you in
reporting and analytics systems.

The following illustration shows the display name of a problem in Studio and in
the LMS.

Unique, descriptive display names help you and your learners identify
components quickly and accurately.
