Reorder and Delete Custom Pages
#####################################

For instructions on how to add custom pages see :ref:`Add Custom Page`.

You can reorder the custom pages in your course in the same way that you :ref:`reorganize the course outline<Reorganize the Course Outline>`:
you drag a page to a different location in the list of pages and drop it there.

.. note:: All default course pages (Course, Progress, Dates, Discussion) and optional course applications (Notes, Teams, Wiki) appear in the navigation before any configured custom page resources. If you have configured any textbook resources, these are listed after custom pages.

To reorder the pages, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Pages & Resources**.
#. Select the **Custom Pages** card on this page.
#. On the list of pages, each page that you can move includes a Drag to reorder icon.
#. Move your pointer over the Drag to reorder icon for the page. Your pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.
#. Click and drag the page to the new location, and then release.

You can also delete a custom page from your course using the delete icon shown on each custom page from the **Custom Pages** Studio page.
If you delete a page after the course start date, note that the visibility of the page in the learner experience changes immediately.
