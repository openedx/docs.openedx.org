Reorganize Components Within a Unit
*****************************************

To reorganize components within their current unit, you drag and drop
components in the same way you can drag and drop units, subsections, and
sections on the **Course Outline** page. For more information, see
:ref:`Reorganize the Course Outline`.

For components that consist of nested components (for example, a content
experiment), you can also use drag and drop to move a child component into a
different parent component, if both parents are expanded. For example, you can
select the video component that is in Child Component A and drag it into Child
Component B. Select the video component, and as you drag it into Child
Component B, release the mouse button when a dashed outline of the component
you are moving appears in the new location.

You can also drag a child component outside of a parent, so that the child
moves to the same level as the parent.


Move Components to Other Units
********************************

To move components to another unit in the course outline, follow these steps.

#. Select the **Move** icon for the component you want to move.

   A dialog box appears that displays your course outline tree, starting at the
   section level.

#. In the **Move** dialog box, navigate to the location where you want to move
   the component by selecting the section, the subsection, and then the unit.

   The **Move** button is enabled only when your selected location is a valid
   level and location for moving your component. For example, when you move a
   component, the **Move** button is enabled only when you have navigated to
   a unit to which the component can be moved.

#. Select **Move**.

   The component moves to the new location. A success message appears that
   provides options to go to the new location or to undo the move.

   .. note::

       If the old and new locations of the component you moved were
       previously published, your changes are not reflected in the learner's
       view of the course until you republish the affected units.
