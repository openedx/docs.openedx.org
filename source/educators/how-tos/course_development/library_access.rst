Give Other Users Access to Your Legacy Library
##############################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

.. warning::

   The Legacy Libraries feature will be supported through Ulmo, moving to
   unsupported in Verawood. Ulmo will include a one-click migration feature that
   will make it easy to convert a Legacy Library into the new Library interface.

   See :ref:`Content Libraries Redesign Teak` for more information.

When you create a legacy library, you are automatically assigned an Admin role in that
legacy library.

You can give other Studio users access to your legacy library. Depending on the level
of access  that you give them in the legacy library, additional legacy library users can view
and use legacy library content in courses, edit legacy library content, or add and manage
other legacy library users. All users to whom you give legacy library access must be
registered with Studio and have an active account.

These are the levels of access for libraries.

* **User** -- Users can view legacy library content and can use legacy library components in
  their courses, but they cannot edit the contents of a legacy library.

* **Staff** -- Staff can use legacy library components in their courses. In addition,
  as content co-authors, they have full editing privileges in a legacy library.

* **Admin** -- Admins have full editing privileges for a legacy library. In addition,
  they can add and remove other team members from legacy library access. There must be
  at least one user with Admin privileges in a legacy library.

.. note:: The levels of access for libraries are hierarchical. You can add new
   legacy library members only with the **User** level of access, after which you can
   give them the **Staff** level of access. You can give the **Admin** level of
   access only to people who already have the **Staff** level of access.

*********************************
Add a User to the legacy library
*********************************

To grant a user initial **User** access to a legacy library, follow these steps.

.. note:: Only legacy library users with the **Admin** level of access can add users
   to the legacy library.

#. Ensure that the new legacy library member has an active Studio account.

#. On the Studio home page, select the **Legacy Libraries** tab and locate the legacy library
   to which you are adding this user.

#. From the **Settings** menu select **User Access**.

#. On the **User Access** page, select **Add a New User**.

#. Enter the new user's email address, then select **ADD USER**.

   The new user is added to the list of legacy library members with the **User** level
   of access.

**************************************
Remove a User from the legacy library
**************************************

You can remove users from the legacy library at any time, regardless of the level of
access that they have.

To remove a user from the legacy library, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select the **Legacy Libraries** tab and locate your legacy library.

#. From the **Settings** menu select **User Access**.

#. On the **User Access** page, locate the user that you want to remove.

#. Hover over the user's box and select the trash can icon.

   You are prompted to confirm the deletion.

#. Select **Delete**.

  The user is removed from the legacy library.

*************************
Add Staff or Admin Access
*************************

The levels of access for libraries are hierarchical. You can add new legacy library
members only with the **User** level of access, after which you can give them
the **Staff** level of access. You can give the **Admin** level of access only
to people who already have the **Staff** level of access.

To give a legacy library member a higher level of access to the legacy library, follow these
steps.

#. In Studio, select the **Legacy Libraries** tab and locate your legacy library.

#. From the **Settings** menu select **User Access**.

#. On the **User Access** page, locate the user to whom you are giving
   additional privileges.

  - If he currently has **User** access, select **Add Staff Access**.
  - If he currently has **Staff** access, select **Add Admin Access**.

  The user's display listing is updated to indicate the new level of access. In
  addition, their listing now includes a button to remove their current level
  of access and move them back to their previous level of access. For details
  about reducing a user's level of access to a legacy library, see :ref:`Remove Staff
  or Admin Access<Remove Staff or Admin Access>`.
  
.. _Remove Staff or Admin Access:

****************************
Remove Staff or Admin Access
****************************

After you have granted users **Staff** or **Admin** access, you (or other
**Admin** legacy library users) can reduce their levels of access.

To remove **Staff** or **Admin** access from a legacy library user, follow these
steps.

#. In Studio, select the **Legacy Libraries** tab and locate your legacy library.

#. From the **Settings** menu select **User Access**.

#. On the **User Access** page, locate the user whose access level you are
   changing.

  - If she currently has **Staff** access, select **Remove Staff Access**.
  - If she currently has **Admin** access, select **Remove Admin Access**.

   The user's display listing is updated to indicate the new role.

.. note:: There must always be at least one Admin for a legacy library. If there is
   only one user with the Admin role, you cannot remove him or her from the
   Admin role unless you first assign another user to the Admin role.
