If you do not change the :ref:`course start date<Set Start and End Dates>`
default value, ``1/1/2030``, when you create a new section, its release date
will be ``Unscheduled``.

If you have modified the course start date, when you create a new section, the
default release date is the course start date.

.. caution::
 If the course start date is in the past, newly created sections are
 immediately visible to learners.

To create a new section, follow these steps.

#. On the **Course Outline** page, select **New Section**. This option appears
   at both the top of the page and below the current sections in the outline.

   A new section appears at the end of the course content, with the section
   name selected.

#. Enter the name for the new section. A descriptive name can help learners
   locate content in the course. It can also help you select content when
   you analyze performance in reporting or analytics systems.

#. :ref:`Add subsections<Create a Subsection>` to the new section as needed.

It is recommended that you :ref:`test course content <Testing Your Course
Content>` as you create new sections.

   The **Settings** dialog box opens.

#. Enter the release date and time for the section.

  .. note::
   The time that you set is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You might want
   to verify that you have specified the time that you intend by using a time
   zone converter such as `Time and Date Time Zone Converter`_.

#. Select **Save**.

For more information, see :ref:`Release Dates`.

To publish all new and changed units in a section, select the **Publish** icon
in the box for the section.

.. note::
 The **Publish** icon only appears when there is new or changed content within
 the section.

For more information about statuses and visibility to learners, see :ref:`Unit
Publishing Status`.

.. _Hide a Section from Students:

********************************
Hide a Section from Learners
********************************

You can hide all content in a section from learners, regardless of the status
of subsections and units within the section.

For more information, see :ref:`Content Hidden from Students`.

To hide a section from learners, follow these steps.

#. Select the **Configure** icon in the section box.

   .. image:: /_images/educator_how_tos/section-settings-box.png
    :alt: The section settings icon circled.
    :width: 500

   The **Settings** dialog box opens.

#. In the **Section Visibility** section, select **Hide from learners**.

#. Select **Save**.

Now, none of the content in the section is visible to learners.

To make the section visible to learners, repeat these steps and deselect **Hide
from learners**.

.. warning::  When you deselect **Hide from learners** for a section, not all
   content in the section is necessarily made visible to learners. If you
   explicitly set a subsection or unit to be hidden from learners, it remains
   hidden from learners. Unpublished units remain unpublished, and changes to
   published units remain unpublished.


********************************
Delete a Section
********************************

When you delete a section, you delete all subsections and units within the
section.

.. warning::
 You cannot restore course content after you delete it. To ensure you do not
 delete content you may need later, you can move any unused content to a
 section in your course that you set to never release.

To delete a section, follow these steps.

#. Select the **Delete** icon in the section that you want to delete.

  .. image:: /_images/educator_how_tos/section-delete.png

   section**.
