.. admonition:: Publish Your Updated Library Content

    In order to sync a piece of content within a course to the latest version in
    the Library, the updated Library content must first be published before it
    will be available to sync within the course.

#. When a piece of content is updated and re-published in a Library, the sync
   button appears with the text :guilabel:`UPDATE AVAILABLE`.

#. Click the button to start the sync process.

#. A modal pops up to show the old version and the new version of the content.
   Review the changes.

#. Choose to :guilabel:`Accept changes`, or :guilabel:`Ignore changes` if you'd
   prefer to keep your current version of the content.
