.. warning::

   The Legacy Libraries feature will be supported through Ulmo, moving to
   unsupported in Verawood. Ulmo includes a :ref:`one-click migration feature
   <Migrating Legacy Libraries>` that makes it easy to convert a Legacy Library
   into the new Library interface.

   See :ref:`Content Libraries Redesign Teak` for more information.

You cannot delete a legacy library. Instead, you can discontinue use of an unwanted
legacy library. To do so, follow the next steps:

#. First, make sure that none of its components are in use in
any courses.

#. Delete all components in the legacy library. 

#. :ref:`Edit the name of the legacy library<Edit a Legacy Library>` to make it clear to other course team
members that the legacy library should not be used as a source of randomized
assignment content in courses.
