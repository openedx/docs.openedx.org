You can :ref:`export<Export a Library>` and :ref:`import<Import a Library>` a
content library in Studio.

.. _Export a Library:

Export a Library
************************

There are several reasons why you might want to export your library.

* To save your work in progress
* To edit the XML in your library directly
* To create a backup copy of your library
* To share with another course team member

When you export your library, Studio creates a **.zip** file. This export file
contains the problems in the library, including any customizations you made in
the library to problem settings. The export does not include library settings
such as user access permissions.

To export a library, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select the **Libraries** tab.

#. Locate the library that you want to export.

#. From the **Tools** menu, select **Backup to local archive**.

#. Select **Download Library Backup** next to your library's name to dowload the archive.

When the export process finishes, you can access the ``.zip`` file on your
computer.

.. _Import a Library:

Import a Library
*************************

.. note::

   Currently, library import is only supported as a way to initialize a new library.

The  library file that you import must be a ``.zip`` file that contains a
``package.toml`` file.

To import a library, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select the **+ New library** button in the top right.

   ..  image:: /_images/educator_how_tos/new_library_button.png
   	:alt: The "+New Library" button appears in the top right corner of the Studio homepage

#. Select **Create from archive** button in the top right.

   ..  image:: /_images/educator_how_tos/create_library_from_archive.png
   	:alt: The "Create from archive" button appears in the top right corner of the "Create new library" page

#. Drag and drop the file, or click to upload, your ``.zip`` file.

#. After your file is uploaded, you'll see information about the imported
   library at the top of the screen:
