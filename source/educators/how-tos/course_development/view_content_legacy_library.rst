   The Legacy Libraries feature will be supported through Ulmo, moving to
   unsupported in Verawood. Ulmo includes a :ref:`one-click migration feature
   <Migrating Legacy Libraries>` that makes it easy to convert a Legacy Library
   into the new Library interface.

   See :ref:`Content Libraries Redesign Teak` for more information.

To view the entire contents of a legacy library in Studio, follow these steps.

#. Log in to Studio.

#. Select **Legacy Libraries**, then select the legacy library whose components you want to
   view.

#. Optionally, select **Hide Previews** at the top right of the legacy library page to
   collapse the component previews and see only the list of component display
   names. To return to the full preview of components in the legacy library, select
   **Show Previews**.

The components in the legacy library are shown in the order in which they were added,
with the most recently added at the bottom. If your legacy library has more than 10
components, additional components are shown on other pages.

The range of the components shown on the current page, and the total number of
components, are shown at the top of the page.

You can navigate through the pages in the following ways.

* Use the **<** and **>** buttons at the top and bottom of the list to navigate
  to the previous and next pages.

* At the bottom of the page, you can edit the first number in the page range.
  Select the number to place your cursor in the field, then enter the page
  number you want to jump to.
