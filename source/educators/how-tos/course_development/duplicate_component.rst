Duplicate a Component
#####################

When you duplicate a component, a new copy of that component is added directly
beneath the first component. You can then modify the duplicate. In many cases,
duplicating a component and editing the copy is a faster way to create new
content.

To duplicate a component, select the **Duplicate** icon in the component
header.

Then, follow instructions for the type of component you are editing.

After you duplicate a component, the new component is not visible to learners
until you :ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.

.. note::  Duplicating content experiments after you have configured them is not
   supported.
