Enabling the Textbooks Resources
#################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

You can add textbooks in PDF format to your course using the Textbooks resource area. Each textbook that
you add is displayed to learners as a page, or tab, in the course navigation bar.

.. note:: Do not use image files (for example, .png files) as textbooks for your course, because they are not accessible to learners who use screen readers. For more information, review :ref:`Creating Accessible PDFs`.

To add a textbook resource to your course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Pages & Resources**.
#. Select the **Textbooks** card on this page.
#. Select either **Add your first textbook** or **New Textbook**.
#. On the page that opens, enter the **Textbook Name**.
#. Enter the **Chapter Name**.
#. Next to **Chapter Asset**, select **Upload PDF** to upload a PDF from your computer, and then follow the prompts to upload your file.
#. To add more chapters, select **Add a Chapter** and repeat steps 5 and 6.
#. Select **Save**.

.. note:: When you add a textbook to your course, Studio automatically adds each PDF file that you upload to the **Files & Uploads page**. The recommendation is that you upload a separate PDF for each textbook chapter. When learners open the textbook page in the course, they can navigate the textbook by chapter.

You can delete a custom textbook from your course using the delete icon shown on each textbook from the Textbooks
Studio page. It is also possible to delete a specific chapter from a textbook when editing a textbook using
the close icon to the right of each listed chapter.

.. note:: After you delete your textbook on the Textbooks page, it is strongly recommended that you :ref:`lock <Lock a File>` or :ref:`delete <Delete a File>` the PDF files for the textbook on the Files & Uploads page to avoid copyright issues.
