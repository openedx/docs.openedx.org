     feedback for the problem. For more information about how the text in these
     fields appears in a drag and drop problem, see
     :ref:`overview_of_drag_and_drop_problems`.

   * Specify a background image in the **Background URL** field. Enter the URL
     of a file you have added to your course or the URL of an image on the web.

You can change the visual appearance of drag and drop problems in your courses.

The **Background color** and **Text color** controls for the draggable items in
a drag and drop problem set the appearance of items for an individual problem.
You can choose colors for the background and text of items when you create or
edit a drag and drop problem.

  You can develop a Python programming language module and include a custom
  Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file for drag and drop problems in your Open edX
  site. For more information, see
