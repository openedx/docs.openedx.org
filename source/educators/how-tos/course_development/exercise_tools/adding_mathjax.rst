In the Text component editor, you can use MathJax in both visual view and
HTML view.

************************************
Adding MathJax to Problem Components
************************************

In the problem component editor, you can use MathJax in either the simple
editor or advanced editor.

In the example that follows, note that the Einstein equation in the explanation
is enclosed in backslashes and parentheses, so it appears inline with the text.
The Navier-Stokes equation is enclosed in backslashes and brackets, so it
appears on its own line (display).
