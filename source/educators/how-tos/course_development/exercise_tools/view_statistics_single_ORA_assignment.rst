View Statistics for a Single ORA Assignment
############################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

To view metrics about learners in a single ORA assignment, including the number
who are active in each step, follow these steps.

#. Open the ORA assignment in the course.

#. Scroll to the bottom of the assignment and select **View Assignment
   Statistics**.

   You see statistics for the assignment, including the total number of
   responses and the location ID for the assignment.

   In the **Learner Progress** section, for each assessment step in the
   assignment, you can see the number of learners who are currently working
   through (but who have not completed) that step. Only assessment types that
   exist in the assignment are included.

   .. note:: If a Staff Assessment step exists in the assignment, this step
      will always show 0 active learners, because no learner actions are
      required for that step.

   In addition to learners who are active in the assessment steps of the
   assignment, you can see the number of learners who are in the following
   states in the assignment.

     * **Waiting**: Learners who have finished the requirements for a step
       and are waiting for their responses to be assessed by peers or staff.

     * **Done**: Learners who have completed all of their required steps, and
       have received the required number of reviews.

     * **Cancelled**: Learners who have had their responses cancelled.

In the **Dates** section below **Learner Progress**, the release and due dates
for each step in the assignment are shown.
