Following the next steps, you can :ref:`Write Your Own Grader` using Python in your Open edX instance. In custom Python-evaluated input (also called "write-your-own-grader" problems), the grader uses a Python script that you create and embed in the problem to evaluate a learner's response or provide hints. These problems can be any type. Numerical input and text input problems are the most common write-your-own-grader problems.

#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, select **Problem** under
   **Add New Component**.

#. In the problem editor, select **Advanced problem types**. Then select **Custom Python-Evaluated Input**.

#. In the component editor, modify the example as needed.

#. Select **Save**.

You can also use :ref:`Script Tag Format` or answer tag format to create these problems. Learn how to :ref:`Create a Custom Python Evaluated Input Problem in Script Tag Format`.
