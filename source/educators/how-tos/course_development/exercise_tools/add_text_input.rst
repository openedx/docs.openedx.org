Adding Feedback

For an overview of feedback in problems, see :ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to
a Problem`. In text input problems, you can provide feedback for the correct
answer or for a specified incorrect answer. Use feedback on incorrect answers
as an opportunity to address common learner misconceptions. Feedback for text
input questions should also provide guidance to the learner on how to arrive at
the correct answer.

If you define multiple correct responses for the question, you can define
feedback for each response.

You can add answer-specific feedback for each answer in a text input problem.
You can access the feedback panel shown below by clicking the button to the
