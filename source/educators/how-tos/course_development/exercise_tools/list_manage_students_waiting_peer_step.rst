List and Manage Students Waiting in Peer Step
#############################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

On ORA problems with the peer assessment step, sometimes learners might get stuck
waiting for peer responses to evaluate or peer reviews from other learners indefinitely.
There's a tool in the instructor dashboard that allows listing and managing those
learners.

To view a list of students in the waiting step of an ORA problem in a course, follow
these steps.

#. View the live version of the course.
#. Select **Instructor** to open the instructor dashboard.
#. On the instructor dashboard, select **Open Responses**.
#. In the table listing the ORA problems, locate the waiting column corresponding to
   the problem you want to see users waiting on.
#. If there are any students in the waiting step, the column will become clickable.
#. Select it to open the **Waiting step details** page.

The **Waiting step details** page displays some information related to the peer step
configuration and a table listing users in the waiting step with the
following attributes:

* Usernames
* Number of peers assessed
* Number of peer reviews received
* Time spent on the waiting step so far
* Status from staff assessment step, if available in the problem
* Final grade status (waiting or overwritten).

The **Waiting step details** page also allows managing student grades through the
**Manage individual learners** button near the bottom of the page, which works in
the same manner as :ref:`Access Information for a Specific Learner`.
