Overview
********

Learners can use the Open edX calculator tool to perform simple
and complex calculations. Learners can enter input including numbers,
operators, Greek letters, affixes, trigonometric functions, and more.

The calculator is available for every Open edX course, but it is not visible by
default. To make the calculator visible, you must enable it in the course
advanced settings.

When the calculator is visible in a course, the calculator icon appears at the
bottom of every unit page.

edge of the browser window.

The calculator includes an information page that learners can use if they have
questions about entering input in the calculator. Learners access the
calculator's information page by selecting the ``i`` icon next to the input
field.
