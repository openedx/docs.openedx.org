#. In the new component, click the **Edit button, or pencil icon**.

#. In the **Name** field, enter the name for the new component. This will be
   displayed above the component as a title.

#. In the **PDF URL** field, set the URL of the PDF you would like to embed.

   If you do not have an existing URL for your PDF, you may upload the PDF by
   :ref:`adding it as a handout<Add Course Updates and Handouts>` and copy the
   URL of the resulting handout.

#. Toggle the **PDF Download Allowed** field to optionally display a
   download link for the PDF.

.. note::

    PDF display is handled by the browser's built-in PDF viewer. The option to hide the download button will not hide the browser's built-in download button if it provides one. A determined learner will always be able to download a PDF.


#. In the **Source document URL** field, optionally add the URL to the source
   of the PDF document.

   This might be, for instance, the power point or word document this PDF is
   based on. Providing a source URL is heavily encouraged, as source files
   tend to have better accessibility than PDFs. Please visit the
   :ref:`Accessibility Best Practices Checklist` for more information.

#. In the **Source document button text** field, you can change the display
   text of the source download link.

#. Select **Save**.
