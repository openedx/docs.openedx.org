***********************************

Before you can add Google Drive files to your course, you must enable the
Google Drive tool in Studio or OLX (open learning XML).

To enable the Google Drive tool in Studio, you add the ``"google-document"``
key to the **Advanced Module List** on the **Advanced Settings** page. For
more information, see :ref:`Enable Additional Exercises and Tools`.

Alternatively, you can use OLX to enable the Google Drive tool.

********************************

To enable Google Drive files in your course, you edit the XML file that
defines the course structure. You locate the ``course`` element's
``advanced-modules`` attribute, and add the string ``google-document``
to it.

For example, the following XML code enables Google Drive files in a course. It
also enables Google calendars.

.. code-block:: xml

  <course advanced_modules="[&quot;google-document&quot;,
      &quot;google-calendar&quot;]" display_name="Sample Course"
      start="2014-01-01T00:00:00Z">
      ...
  </course>

.. _Obtain the Google Drive File Embed Code:

#. Copy the complete string in the **Embed** field, including the ``<iframe>``
   tags.

   .. note::
    Google images do not have an ``<iframe>`` tag. To embed an image, you copy
    the complete ``img`` tag.

   You use that string to configure the Google Drive file component.
