.. _Use Feedback in a Single Select Problem:

Adding Feedback
***************

For an overview of feedback in problems, see :ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to
a Problem`. You can add feedback for each of the answer options you provide in
the problem. Use the following guidelines when providing feedback.

* Add feedback to incorrect answers to target common misconceptions and
  mistakes.

* Ensure feedback provides some guidance to the learner about how to arrive at
  the correct answer.

* Add feedback for the correct answer to reinforce why the answer is correct.
  Because learners are able to guess, ensure that feedback provides a reason
  why the answer is correct for learners who might have selected that answer by
  chance.

You can add answer-specific feedback for each answer in a single select problem.
You can access the feedback panel shown below by clicking the button to the
right of the answer text.
