Add a Peer Instruction Component
***********************************

After you :ref:`enable the peer instruction tool <Enable the Peer Instruction
Tool>` for your course, you can add the component for a peer instruction
assignment.

#. On the **Course Outline** page, locate the subsection where you want to add
   the assignment and add or open a unit.

#. Under **Add New Component**, select **Advanced**, and then select **Peer
   Instruction**. Studio adds the new component to the unit and uses a template
   to supply a sample question, answers, and so on.

#. Select **Edit**.

#. In the component editor, replace the default component display name with an
   identifying name. In the LMS, this name appears as a heading above the
   assignment.

   Unique, descriptive display names can help you identify individual
   assignments quickly and accurately for analysis.

#. Select **Save**, or continue on to replace the template information with the
   details for this assignment.


Add the Assignment Details
**************************

Before you add the details of the assignment to a peer instruction component,
you :ref:`design the assignment<Designing a Peer Instruction Assignment>` by
preparing a question, answer choices, and other required elements. If the
question or any of the answer choices includes an image, you also
:ref:`upload<Upload PI Images>` the image file and obtain its Studio
URL so that you can add it to the assignment.

To enter all of the assignment details into the component editor, follow these
steps.

#. In the new component, select **Edit**.

#. For the assignment question, enter text, add an image, or both.

   * To add text, enter the question that you want learners to consider in the
     **Question Text** field.

   * To add an image, follow these steps.

     #. Select **Add Image to Question**. Additional fields appear.

     #. In the **Image URL** field, paste or enter the Studio URL from the
        **Files & Uploads** page.

     #. Specify the **Image Position**. If your question does not include text,
        **Appears above** and **Appears below** have the same result.

     #. Provide a description of the image. This description should provide
        enough detail so that learners who cannot see the image, and who rely
        on screen readers to complete your course, can understand the question.

#. Select a minimum and maximum length for the written explanations your
   learners supply for their answer choices.

   You can change the supplied default values as needed to require explanations
   that are longer than 1 character, or limit explanations to less than
   32,000 characters (approximately 12 pages).

#. Enter each answer choice. You can enter text, add an image, or both.
   For information on how to add an image, see step 2.

   The template for this component has three sample answer choices.

   * If your question has more than three answer choices, select **Add New
     Answer** and then enter the answer. You can include up to 10 answer
     choices.

   * To delete an answer choice, select the **X** next to the text field for
     that answer.

#. Specify which of the answer choices is the correct answer. Alternatively, you
   can choose to not specify a correct answer by selecting "n/a". You identify
   the correct answer choice by its assigned number: to indicate Answer 1 you
   select **Option 1**, for Answer 2 you select **Option 2**, and so on.

#. Enter a text explanation that describes why the specified answer choice is
   correct. This is optional if you have chosen to not specify a correct answer.

#. Configure how, and how many, peer responses to show to learners after
   they submit an initial response.

   * To guide selection of the responses to show, select either **Random** or
     **Simple**. For more information, see :ref:`Designing a Peer Instruction
     Assignment`.

   * Specify how many responses learners should be given to review. The
     default, **#**, shows learners the same number of responses as there are
     answer options.

#. Enter your example explanations. For each of the answer choices you enter in
   step 4, you must supply an example explanation. You identify each answer
   choice by its assigned number: to indicate Answer 1 you select **Option 1**,
   for Answer 2 you select **Option 2**, and so on.

   The template for this component includes three example explanations.

   * If your question has more than three answer choices, you select **Add New
     Example**, and then identify the answer choice and enter the example
     explanation for each of the other answer choices.

   * To delete an example explanation, select the **X** next to the list of
     numbered choices.

#. Select **Save**.

   If **Save** is not available, an edit check has detected incomplete or
   invalid information in the component editor. Review your entries to make
   sure that each field has an entry (as appropriate), and that you have
   provided an example explanation for each answer choice. For information
   about the error found, move your cursor over the question mark that
   appears next to **Save**.

************************************************
Reviewing a Histogram of Learner Responses
************************************************

When learners submit their final answer choices and revised explanations, the
peer instruction tool displays the correct answer, if you have specified one,
and its explanation (if applicable). The learner's initial answer and response,
and final answer and response, follow.

As soon as 10 learners complete the assignment, the peer instruction tool
displays a pair of class breakdown histograms. These histograms show how
frequently learners selected each of the options, before and after they
reviewed the responses submitted by other class participants.

.. _Upload PI Images:

Upload Images (Optional)
**************************

If the question or an answer choice in an assignment includes an image, you
:ref:`upload the image file<Upload a File>` on the **Files & Uploads** page.
The **Studio URL** for the image can then be added to the question or
answer choice in the peer instruction component.
