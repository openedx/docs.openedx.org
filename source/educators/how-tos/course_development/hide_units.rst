Make a Hidden Unit Visible to Learners
**************************************

Before you make a hidden unit visible to learners, be aware that course content
will immediately be visible to learners, as follows.

* For a hidden unit that previously was published, deselecting **Hide from
  learners** publishes the current content for the unit. If you made changes to
  the unit while is was hidden, those draft changes are published.

* When you make a section or subsection that was previously hidden visible to
  learners, draft content in units is *not* published. Changes you made since
  last publishing units are not made visible to learners.

You can make a hidden unit visible to learners from the unit page or the course
outline. Follow the instructions above and clear the **Hide from learners**
check box.

You are prompted to confirm that you want to make the unit visible to learners.
