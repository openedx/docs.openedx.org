To create a new library, follow these steps.

#. Log in to Studio.

#. Select **Libraries** from the Studio home page. 

#. Select **New Library**.

#. Enter the required information for your new library, then select **Create**.

   .. note:: Enter new library information carefully. The values in these
      fields become part of the URL for your library, therefore the total
      number of characters in the **Library Name**, **Organization**, and
      **Library ID** fields must be 65 or fewer.

  - For **Library Name**, enter the public display name for your library.
    Choose a meaningful name that will help you and other course team members
    to identify the library. For example, "Level 200 Math Problems". 

  - For **Organization**, enter the identifier for your university. For
    example, enter HarvardX or MITx. Do not include spaces or special
    characters.

  - For **Library ID**, enter an identifier for your library that is unique
    within your organization. This code becomes part of the URL for your
    library, so do not include spaces or special characters in the code.

4. Select **Create**.

You see the new library, to which you can now add components. For information
about adding components to a library, see :ref:`Build a Collection in a Library` and :ref:`Create and edit content in a Library`.

After you create a library, you are automatically assigned an **Admin** role
for the library. For information about adding other users to a library after
you create it, see :ref:`Add users to Libraries`.
