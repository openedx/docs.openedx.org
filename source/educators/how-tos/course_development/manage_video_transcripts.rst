.. note::
   This section is for videos that do not have integrated transcripts. Only use
   this option for transcripts in ``.srt`` format. If you want to provide a
   transcript in any other format, such as ``.pdf``, see
   :ref:`Additional Transcripts`.

You can provide transcripts for your video in more than one language. To do
this, you work with a third-party service to obtain an ``.srt`` transcript file for
each language, and then associate the ``.srt`` file with the video in Studio.

Before you add a transcript file, make sure that each file has a unique name.
If you use the same transcript name more than once, only the most recently
added transcript will appear for every video component that is set up to use a
transcript with that name. To avoid this problem, a best practice is to name
additional transcript files by appending the transcript's language to the video
file name.

For example, you have two videos, named ``video1.mp4`` and ``video2.mp4``, and their
original transcripts are named ``video1.srt`` and ``video2.srt``. When you add Hindi
transcripts for these videos, you name them ``video1_hi.srt`` and ``video2_hi.srt``.
When you add Spanish transcripts for the videos, you name them ``video1_es.srt``
and ``video2_es.srt``.

To add a transcript to a video component, follow these steps.

#. After you obtain the ``.srt`` files, open the video component for the video.

#. Scroll down to the **Transcript** section, and then select **Add a
   transcript**.

#. In the dialog box, browse to the ``.srt`` file for the transcript in that
   language, and then select **Open**.

#. It is recommended to allow transcript downloads by checking the "Allow transcript downloads" button.
   This option improves accessibility by allowing learners to manipulate the
   transcripts as needed, for example magnifying the text for those with vision impairments.
   See :ref:`Downloadable Transcripts`.

#. Repeat steps 2 - 6 for any additional languages.

When your learners view the video, they can select the **Language menu** to
select a language.

.. note::
  You can also use this procedure to upload a different kind of handout for
  learners to download, such as an image or a chart.

By default, a ``.txt`` file is created when you upload an ``.srt`` file, and learners
can download either the ``.srt`` or ``.txt`` transcript when you allow transcript
downloads. For more information about allowing transcript downloads, see
:ref:`Enable Video and Transcript Downloads`.

In addition, you can provide a downloadable transcript in a format such as
``.pdf``. To do this, you upload the additional transcript in the video player as a
handout. Learners see an option to download the handout below the video.

.. note:: See :ref:`Creating Accessible Course Materials` for tips on creating accessible ``.pdf`` documents.

To add another downloadable transcript or handout, follow these steps.

#. Create or obtain your transcript or handout as a ``.pdf`` or in another format.
#. Locate the **Handout** section, and then select **Upload Handout**.
#. In the dialog box, select the file on your computer, and then select
   **Open**.
