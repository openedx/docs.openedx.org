After you have :ref:`Add Components to a Library`, you can edit, duplicate, or
delete them.

For step-by-step instructions for editing, duplicating, or deleting components,
refer to the following topics.

* :ref:`Edit a Component`
* :ref:`Duplicate a Component`
* :ref:`Delete a Component`

.. note:: If you modify components in your library that are in use in a course,
   these updates in the "source" library are not reflected in the course unless
   you manually update the randomized content block in the course unit. For
   details about updating library components used in your course to match the
   latest version in the library, see :ref:`Get the Latest Version of Library
   Content`.
