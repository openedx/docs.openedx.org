Edit Components in a Legacy Library

.. warning::

   The Legacy Libraries feature will be supported through Ulmo, moving to
   unsupported in Verawood. Ulmo includes a :ref:`one-click migration feature
   <Migrating Legacy Libraries>` that makes it easy to convert a Legacy Library
   into the new Library interface.

   See :ref:`Content Libraries Redesign Teak` for more information.

After you have :ref:`Add Components to a Legacy Library`, you can edit, duplicate, or
delete them.

For step-by-step instructions for editing, duplicating, or deleting components,
refer to the following topics.

* :ref:`Edit a Component`
* :ref:`Duplicate a Component`
* :ref:`Delete a Component`

.. note:: If you modify components in your library that are in use in a course,
   these updates in the "source" library are not reflected in the course unless
   you manually update the randomized content block in the course unit. For
   details about updating library components used in your course to match the
   latest version in the library, see :ref:`Get the Latest Version of Legacy Library
   Content`.
