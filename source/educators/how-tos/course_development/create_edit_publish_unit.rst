.. _Edit a Unit:

**************
Edit a Unit
**************

You can edit a unit in the following ways.

* Edit the unit name
* Add components to units
* Reorganize Components in Units

When you make any of these changes, if you previously published the unit, the
state changes to :ref:`Draft Unpublished Changes`. You must then :ref:`publish
the unit<Publish a Unit>` to make your edits visible to learners.

If you are designing your course to :ref:`offer different content<Offering
Differentiated Content>` to different groups of learners, you can also
:ref:`Set access restrictions for the unit<Set Access Restrictions For a
Unit>` to specify which learner groups a unit is available to.


==============================
Edit the Unit Name
==============================

To edit a unit name, on the unit page in Studio, select **Edit** next to the
name.

.. image:: /_images/educator_how_tos/unit-edit-icon.png

The name field becomes editable. Enter the new name, and then tab or click
outside of the field to save the name.


==============================
Reorganize Components in Units
==============================

You can reorganize components within a unit by dragging and dropping them to
new locations.

To change the location of a component, move your mouse pointer over the **Drag
to reorder** handle on the component toolbar. The pointer changes to a four-
headed arrow. You can then drag the component to the location that you want.

In the image that follows, the handle for the discussion component is selected.

A blue outline indicates where the component will land when you release the
mouse button. For example, in the image below, the discussion component is
being moved to the top of the unit.

Delete a Unit
********************************

You delete a unit from the course outline in Studio.

When you delete a unit, you delete all components within the unit.

.. warning::
 You cannot restore course content after you delete it. To ensure that you do
 not delete any content that you need later, move the unit to a
 hidden section or subsection instead of deleting it.

To delete a unit, follow these steps.

#. On the course outline page in Studio, select the **Delete** icon in the box
   for the unit you want to delete.

   .. image:: /_images/educator_how_tos/unit-delete.png

#. When you receive the confirmation prompt, select **Yes, delete this
   unit**.

.. _Preview a Unit:

****************************
Preview a Unit
****************************

You preview a unit to review and test the content before it is visible to
learners.

You can preview a unit before it is published and before the course is live.
In a live course, after the unit is published and if there are no pending
changes, previewing a unit is exactly the same as viewing the live version of
the unit.

To preview the unit, select **Preview** above the status panel in the Studio
unit page.

The unit opens in preview mode in the LMS.

.. note:: When you are revising a previously published unit, it can be helpful
   to preview your changes in one browser window and :ref:`view the published
   unit<View a Published Unit>` in a second window.

For information about previewing and testing content, see :ref:`Testing Your
Course Content`.


.. _Publish a Unit:

****************************
Publish a Unit
****************************

Publishing a unit makes the current version of the unit in Studio available to
learners. In an instructor-paced course, the release dates for the section and
subsection must also have passed for learners to access a published unit.

You publish a unit that has a status of :ref:`Draft Never Published` or :ref:`Draft
Unpublished Changes`. When you publish a unit, the status changes to
Published and Live or Published Not Yet Released.

You can publish a unit from the unit page or the course outline.

For more information about instructor-paced and self-paced courses, see
:ref:`Setting Course Pacing`.

=======================================

.. note::
 The **Publish** icon only appears when there is new or changed content in the
 unit.

.. _Discard Changes to a Unit:

****************************
Discard Changes to a Unit
****************************

When you modify a published unit, your changes are saved in Studio, though the
changes are not visible to learners until you publish the unit again.

If you decide that you never want to publish your changes, you can discard the
changes so that Studio reverts to the last published version of the unit.

To discard changes and revert the Studio version of the unit to the last
published version, select **Discard Changes** in the status panel.

.. caution::
 When you discard changes to a unit, the changes are permanently deleted. You
 cannot retrieve discarded changes or undo the action.

.. _View a Published Unit:

****************************
View a Published Unit
****************************

To view the last published version of a unit in the LMS, select **View Live
Version** at the top of the page.

The unit page opens in the LMS in Staff view. You might be prompted to log in
to the LMS.

If the unit status is :ref:`Draft Unpublished Changes`, you do not see your
changes in the LMS until you publish the unit again.

If the unit status is :ref:`Draft Never Published`, **View Live Version** is not
enabled.

For information about viewing and testing content, see :ref:`Testing Your
Course Content`.
