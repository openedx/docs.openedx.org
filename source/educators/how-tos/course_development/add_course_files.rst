Adding files, such as images, that you can use in your course has the following
steps.

#. The course team uploads a file on the **Files** page in Studio.
#. Studio generates two URLs for the file.

   * The Studio URL is used to add the file inside the course, such as in a
     component or on a page.

   * The web URL is used to add the file outside the course, such as in an
     email message or external web page.

#. The course team adds a link to the file inside or outside the course.
#. The file is visible in the course, email, or external web page.

For more information, see the following topics.

.. note::
  Ensure that you obtain copyright permissions for files and images you upload
  to your course, and that you cite sources appropriately.

To upload one or more files, follow these steps.

#. Create or locate the files on your computer.

   .. note::
     When Studio generates URLs for an uploaded file, the file name becomes
     part of the URL and is visible to students when they access the file.
     Avoid using file names that contain information that you do not want to
     share about the file contents, such as "Answerkey.pdf".

#. On the **Content** menu, select **Files**.

#. On the **Files** page, select the Add Files button at the top of the page
   and select the files that you want to add.

   .. note::
     If you upload a file that has the same name as an existing course file,
     the original file is overwritten without warning.

The **Files** page refreshes to show the uploaded file or files.


.. _File URLs:

*************************************************
Use an Uploaded File Inside or Outside the Course
*************************************************

When you upload a file, Studio assigns a Studio URL and a web URL to the file.
These URLs are found within the three dot menu or the info modal. To use an
uploaded file, you add a link to the Studio URL or the web URL in your content.

.. note::
  If you do not want to allow access to a file from outside your course, you
  can lock the file so that only learners who are signed in and enrolled in
  your course can access the file. For more information, see :ref:`Lock a
  File`.

.. _Add a File or Image Inside the Course:

For more information, see :ref:`Add an Image to a Text Component`.

To add a file or image outside the course, such as to a bulk email message that
you send from the LMS, follow these steps.

#. On the **Files** page, select the Copy Web URL from the three dot menu.

#. In the external content, paste the web URL.

.. note::
  Be sure that you do not use the Studio URL in an email message. For more
  information about sending email messages, see
  :ref:`Send_Bulk_Email`.

.. _Lock a File:

***********

By default, anyone can access a file you upload if they know the web URL, even
if they are not enrolled in your course. You can prevent outside access to a
file by locking the file. When you lock a file, the web URL only allows
learners who are enrolled in your course and signed in to access the file.

To lock a file, select the lock icon in the row for the file.
