To add new :ref:`components<Create and Manage Components>` to your library,
follow these steps.

#. Log in to Studio.

#. Select **Libraries**, then select the library that you want to add
   components to.

#. Select **Add Component**, then select the component type that you want to
   add under **Add New Component**.

For more information about the types of components you can add to a library,
see these topics.

* :ref:`Working with Problem Components`
* :ref:`Working with Video Components`

After you add a component to a library, you can edit its settings. These
settings are retained when the component is selected from the library and used
in a course.

When a component from the library is used in a randomized content block, you
can further edit the component as it exists in the unit, without affecting the
original version in the library. For details, refer to :ref:`Edit Components in
a Library` and :ref:`Get the Latest Version of Library Content <Get the Latest Version of Library Content>`.
