Add Components to a Legacy Library
##################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

.. warning::

   The Legacy Libraries feature will be supported through Ulmo, moving to
   unsupported in Verawood. Ulmo includes a :ref:`one-click migration feature
   <Migrating Legacy Libraries>` that makes it easy to convert a Legacy Library
   into the new Library interface.

   See :ref:`Content Libraries Redesign Teak` for more information.

To add new :ref:`components<Create and Manage Components>` to your legacy library,
follow these steps.

#. Log in to Studio.

#. Select **Legacy Libraries**, then select the legacy library that you want to add
   components to.

#. Select **Add Component**, then select the component type that you want to
   add under **Add New Component**.

For more information about the types of components you can add to a legacy library,
see these topics.

* :ref:`About Text Components<About Text Components>`
* :ref:`Working with Problem Components`
* :ref:`Working with Video Components`

After you add a component to a legacy library, you can edit its settings. These
settings are retained when the component is selected from the legacy library and used
in a course.

When a component from the legacy library is used in a randomized content block, you
can further edit the component as it exists in the unit, without affecting the
original version in the legacy library. For details, refer to :ref:`Edit Components in
a Legacy Library` and :ref:`Get the Latest Version of Library Content <Get the Latest Version of Legacy Library Content>`.
