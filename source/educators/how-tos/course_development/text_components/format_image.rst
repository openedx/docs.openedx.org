Align an Image
**************

To align your image to the right, the left, or the center, follow these steps.

#. In the Text component, select the image.

#. On the toolbar, select the left align, right align, or center icon.

.. _Change the Image Size:

Change the Image Size
*********************

To change the size of your image, follow these steps.

#. In the Text component, select the image you want to edit, and then
   select the Contextual image icon that appears above the image.

#. In the **Image Settings** dialog box, locate **Image Dimensions**, and
   then enter the values you want for the **Width** and **Height**
   options.

   .. note::
    To make sure that the image keeps the same proportions when you change the
    image size, make sure that **Lock proportions** is selected, and enter a
    number in only the **Width** field or the **Height** field. After you tab
    or click outside that field, the number in the other field changes to a
    value that maintains the image proportions.

#. Select **Save**.

If you want to change the image back to the original size, clear the values in
the **Width** and **Height** fields.
