After you create a library, the only change you can make to the initial library
information is to the name. However, at any time, you can make changes to the
components in your library, including adding or deleting components or editing
the settings of components. For details about editing the contents of a
library, see :ref:`Edit Components in a Library` and :ref:`Add Components to a
Library`.

To change the name of a library, follow these steps.

#. Log in to Studio.

#. Select **Libraries**, then select the library whose name you want to edit.

#. Select the **Edit** icon next to the library name.

   The library name field becomes editable.
