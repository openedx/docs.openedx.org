.. warning::

   The Legacy Libraries feature will be supported through Ulmo, moving to
   unsupported in Verawood. Ulmo will include a one-click migration feature that
   will make it easy to convert a Legacy Library into the new Library interface.

   See :ref:`Content Libraries Redesign Teak` for more information.

After you create a legacy library, the only change you can make to the initial legacy library
information is to the name. However, at any time, you can make changes to the
components in your legacy library, including adding or deleting components or editing
the settings of components. For details about editing the contents of a
legacy library, see :ref:`Edit Components in a Legacy Library` and :ref:`Add Components to a
Legacy Library`.

To change the name of a legacy library, follow these steps.

#. Log in to Studio.

#. Select **Legacy Libraries**, then select the legacy library whose name you want to edit.

#. Select the **Edit** icon next to the legacy library name.

   The legacy library name field becomes editable.

For details about giving other users access to the legacy library, see :ref:`Give
Other Users Access to Your Legacy Library`.
