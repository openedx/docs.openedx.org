Set Access Restrictions For a Unit

.. tags:: educator, how-to

If you have more than one enrollment track in your course, or if you have
enabled cohorts, you can limit a unit's availability to specific groups of
learners. For information about offering different content to different learner
groups, see :ref:`Offering Differentiated Content`.

.. note:: A unit's group access settings are inherited by components in the
   unit. If you set additional group access restrictions for a component, make
   sure the component access settings do not contradict the unit access
   settings. For example, you cannot give Group A of learners access to a
   component if Group A does not have access to the unit that contains the
   component.

Tp specify a unit's access settings, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Content**, and then select **Outline**.

#. For the unit that you want to restrict access to, select the **Configure**
   icon in the unit's toolbar.

   You can also access the **Restrict access to** option from the gear icon
   next to a unit's name on a unit page in Studio.

#. In the unit's **Settings** dialog box, for the **Restrict access to**
   option, select the group type by which you want to restrict access.

   The **Enrollment Track Groups** option is available only if your course has
   more than one :ref:`enrollment track<enrollment_track_g>`. The **Content
   Groups** option is available only if you have created :ref:`content
   groups<About Content Groups>` for use with cohorts.

   After you select a group type, you see a list of the groups that exist for
   that group type.

   The groups which have access to the unit are listed under the unit title in
   the Studio course outline, as well as under the unit title on the unit page
   in Studio.
