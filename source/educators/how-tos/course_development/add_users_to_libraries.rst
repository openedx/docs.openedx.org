.. note::

   Only admins on a given library can manage user permissions for that library.

User access permissions in Libraries can be managed via the home page of your library.

Library Permission Levels
**************************

Read-only
---------

Read-only users can view the library and use its content in their courses.

Team members who have Read-only permissions on the content in a library
cannot create new content or edit content. Read-only includes the ability to
search in libraries, and apply filters and sorts.

Author
------

Can view library content, create new library content, edit library content, and
use library content in courses.

They can also create collections, add and remove content from collections, as
well as add and remove tags from content and from collections.

Authors can also see who else is on the team for any library that they are an
author on. Library authors are very similar roles to course staff on the course
side.

Admin
-----

Admins have all the permissions of Authors, but can also add and remove Library Team
members. Only admins can delete entire libraries. Entire libraries can also be
toggled to read-only, and only admins have the permission to switch that toggle.

In terms of intersections with already-existing roles, if you have global admin
access on the platform, you also have library admin permissions on all libraries.
