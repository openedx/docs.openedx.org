Users who are added to Library Teams have full editing capabilities in a
Library. Only Team members have access to a Library.

Libraries can be toggled to “read only” in order to allow anyone with Studio
access read-only access.

To add a user to a Library Team:

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Library info` button. This will open the Library
   sidebar.

#. Click on :guilabel:`Manage Access`.

#. Click on :guilabel:`New team member` and add the email address of the user
   you'd like to add.
