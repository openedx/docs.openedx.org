To create a new subsection, follow these steps.

#. In the outline, expand the section in which you want to create a new
   subsection.
#. Select **New Subsection** at the bottom of the expanded section. A new
   subsection appears at the end of the section, with the subsection name
   selected.
#. Enter the name for the new subsection. A descriptive name can help learners
   locate content in the course. It can also help you select content when you
   analyze performance in reporting and analytics systems.
#. :ref:`Add units<Create a Unit>` to the new subsection as needed.

It is recommended that you :ref:`test course content <Testing Your Course
Content>` as you create new subsections.

   The subsection settings dialog box opens.

#. On the **Basic** tab, under **Release Date and Time**, enter the release
   date and time for the subsection.

   .. note:: The time that you set is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You
      might want to verify that you have specified the time that you intend by
      using a time zone converter such as `Time and Date Time Zone Converter`_.

      Learners who have specified a time zone in their account settings see
      course dates and times converted to their specified time zone. Learners
      who have not specified a time zone in their account settings see course
      dates and times on their dashboards, in the body of the course, and on
      their **Progress** pages in the time zone that their browsers specify.
      Learners see other course dates and times in UTC.

#. Select **Save**.

For more information, see :ref:`Release Dates`.
