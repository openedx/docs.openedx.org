From Sumac onwards, the Library Homepage has been redesigned with a focus on
streamlining workflows for content management, content creation and content
discovery. Each piece of content in a Library is represented with a tile
differentiated by content type (text block, problem and video).

To view more information about a piece of content:

#. Ensure you are working in a Library. From Studio, select the **Libraries** tab, then select a library by selecting one from the list of libraries. You will arrive at the Library Homepage. 

#. Click on a content tile. This will open the sidebar menu for that content.

#. The Preview tab will be open by default, with a preview image of the content displayed in the sidebar.

#. Click on :guilabel:`expand` to see a full-screen image of the content.

sidebars to manage content`.
