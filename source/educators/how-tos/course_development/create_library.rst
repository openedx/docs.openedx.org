Use :ref:`legacy content libraries<Legacy Content Libraries Overview>` to build a pool of components
that can be used in randomized assignments in your courses.

.. warning::

   The Legacy Libraries feature will be supported through Ulmo, moving to
   unsupported in Verawood. Ulmo will include a one-click migration feature that
   will make it easy to convert a Legacy Library into the new Library interface.

   See :ref:`Content Libraries Redesign Teak` for more information.

To create a new legacy library, follow these steps.

#. Log in to Studio.

#. Select **New Library**.

#. Enter the required information for your new legacy library, then select **Create**.

   .. note:: Enter new legacy library information carefully. The values in these
      fields become part of the URL for your legacy library, therefore the total
      number of characters in the **Library Name**, **Organization**, and
      **Library Code** fields must be 65 or fewer.

  - For **Library Name**, enter the public display name for your legacy library.
    Choose a meaningful name that will help you and other course team members
    to identify the legacy library. For example, "Level 200 Math Problems". When you
    add a randomized content block to a course unit, you use the legacy library name
    to specify this legacy library as a source for the randomized assignment.

  - For **Organization**, enter the identifier for your university. For
    example, enter HarvardX or MITx. Do not include spaces or special
    characters.

  - For **Library Code**, enter an identifier for your legacy library that is unique
    within your organization. This code becomes part of the URL for your
    legacy library, so do not include spaces or special characters in the code.

4. Select **Create**.

You see the new legacy library, to which you can now add components. For information
about adding components to a legacy library, see :ref:`Add Components to a Legacy Library`.

After you create a legacy library, you are automatically assigned an **Admin** role
for the legacy library. For information about adding other users to a legacy library after
you create it, see :ref:`Give Other Users Access to Your Legacy Library`.
