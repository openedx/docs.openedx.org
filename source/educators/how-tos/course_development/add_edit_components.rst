To add a component to the unit, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, open the page for the unit.
#. Under **Add New Component**, select a component type. The default component
   types are discussion, HTML, problem, and video.

For more information, see the documentation for the specific component type
that you want to work with.

- :ref:`Working with Discussion Components`
- :ref:`Working with Text Components <working with text components>`
- :ref:`Working with Problem Components`
- :ref:`Working with Video Components`

:ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.

.. _Set the Display Name for a Component:

=====================================
Set the Display Name for a Component
=====================================

The display name identifies the component. This name appears as a heading
above the component in the LMS, and it identifies the component for you in
reporting and analytics systems.

The following illustration shows the display name of a problem in Studio and in
the LMS.

Unique, descriptive display names help you and your learners identify
components quickly and accurately.

To set the display name for a component, follow these steps.

#. Edit the component. A dialog box opens.

   * For a discussion or video component, the dialog box opens to the list of
     settings, including the **Display Name** field.

   * For an HTML or problem component, the dialog box opens to an editing view.
     Select **Settings** to show the list of settings, including the **Display
     Name** field.

#. Edit the **Display Name** field.

#. Select **Save**.

Different types of components have different fields in the **Settings** dialog
box, but all of them have a **Display Name** field.


.. _Duplicate a Component:

**********************
Duplicate a Component
**********************

When you duplicate a component, a new copy of that component is added directly
beneath the first component. You can then modify the duplicate. In many cases,
duplicating a component and editing the copy is a faster way to create new
content.

To duplicate a component, select the **Duplicate** icon in the component
header.

.. image:: /_images/educator_how_tos/unit-dup.png
  :alt: A unit with the Duplicate icon selected and highlighted.

Then, follow instructions for the type of component you are editing.

After you duplicate a component, the new component is not visible to learners
until you :ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.

.. note::  Duplicating content experiments after you have configured them is not
   supported.


.. _Delete a Component:

**********************
