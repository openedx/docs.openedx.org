Set Section Highlights for Highlight Emails
***********************************************************


If your Open edX system adminstrator has configured your instance of the Open
edX platform to send course highlight emails, you can send automatic email
messages to learners in your course that contain three to five "highlights"
of upcoming course content. A highlight is a brief description of an
important concept, idea, or activity in the section. Your Open edX system
administrator provides the template for this course highlight email, and
you enter the highlights for the email in Studio.

For more information, contact your Open edX system administrator.

.. note::
   The highlights that you specify persist when you re-run your course.

Send Highlight Emails
=========================================

To send highlight emails to your learners, you must first set highlights
for each section. When you have set section highlights, you then enable the
**Course Highlight Emails** setting.

The number of highlights that you have set for a section is
visible in the course outline, below the name of the section.

  .. note::
    If your Open edX system adminstrator has not configured your instance of
    the Open edX platform to send course highlight messages, learners do
    not receive messages even if you enable highlights and enter highlights for
    each section.

To set highlights for a course section, follow these steps.

#. On the **Course Outline** page, locate the section you want, and then select
   **Section Highlights** under the section name.
#. In the **Highlights for <section name>** dialog box, enter three to five
   highlights for the section. Enter one highlight in each field. Each
   highlight can include up to 250 characters.
#. Select **Save**.

Enable Highlight Emails
********************************************

.. note::
   If you do not enable highlights, the edX platform does not send
   course highlight emails, even if you enter highlights for one or more
   sections.

   You cannot disable highlight emails after you enable them. If you do
   not want to send highlight emails after you enable them, you can
   delete highlights in all sections.
