.. _Migrating Legacy Libraries:

Migrate Legacy Libraries to the New Library Environment
#######################################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

In Verawood, Legacy libraries will no longer be supported. They are being
replaced with the :ref:`new, fully-featured Library experience <Ulmo Libraries>`
introduced in Sumac. The new feature allows you to create any type of content in
a library - including content blocks, units, subsections and sections. All
content can be reused across courses. To take full advantage of the new
features, and to continue using the content in your Legacy Libraries, migrate
your Legacy Libraries.

Navigate your new Library
*************************

#. All of the content from your Legacy Library is viewable from the “All
   Content” tab. If you migrated more than one Legacy Library, all of the
   content from each Legacy Library can be viewed in aggregate.

#. Each Legacy Library can also be viewed as a separate collection within the
   new Library. Click on the Collections tab to view each of your Legacy
   Libraries.

   .. admonition:: Publish Migrated Content

      All migrated content is created in the "Draft" state in the new Library. It must be :ref:`published <Publish Library content>` in order to be reused in courses.

.. _Update Legacy References:

Update course content referenced in Legacy Libraries
****************************************************

   content. You will see a notification that the Library is no longer supported
   and needs to be updated in order to sync any future content changes. Click
   “update reference”.
   
   .. note::

      Content in the Library must be :ref:`published <Publish Library content>` before any references can be synced.

       :alt: The Studio Unit page of a piece of content that uses content from a Legacy Library. There is a link to "Update reference" from the Legacy Library to the New Library.

#. You will now see the content referenced in the course. Any future changes
   made to the referenced content can now be synced to the course using the :ref:`Sync Content workflows <Sync a Library update to your course>`.

   ..  image:: /_images/educator_how_tos/migrate_Legacy_library_sync_content_complete.png
       :alt: The unit page after the reference has been updated. At this point, there is no indication that the content used to link to a Legacy Library.
