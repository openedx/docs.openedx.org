.. note::

   Users must have "Author" or "Admin" permissions on a library to manage tags.
   See :ref:`Add users to Libraries` for more detail.

With the Content Tagging feature, authors and instructional designers are able
to add tags to their Library content. This includes the ability to tag any
individual blocks like problems and videos.

Tags are organized into structured taxonomies, or controlled vocabularies. The
platform supports the use of any third-party taxonomy, which means that course
administrators and subject matter experts are free to use any taxonomies they
wish. Administrators and SMEs can also create their own taxonomies. See
:ref:`Content Tagging Release Notes (Redwood)`.

.. note::

   * Multi-level taxonomies may contain parent and children tags, where children tags are nested underneath the parent tag. When a child tag is selected, its parent tag is automatically added as well. When a parent tag is selected, its children tags are not automatically added.
   * In multi-level taxonomies, deleting a child tag will automatically delete its parent tag.
   * Tags remain attached to Library content when the content is reused in courses.
