Discussion posts can include the option to be posted anonymously so that the poster's identity is not revealed to students in the course. The poster's identity is available to Discussion Admins, Discussion Moderators, and Community TAs, and Group Community TAs. 

	Note that an admin must be a "Discussion Admin" in order to view anonymous posts. This role is separate from a course staff or course admin.For instructions on how to assign discussion administration roles, see :ref:`Assign discussion roles`.
