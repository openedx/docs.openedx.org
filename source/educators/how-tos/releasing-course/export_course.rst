When you have released your course, you can use the course export and import
tools in Studio to save a backup copy of the course, and optionally re-import
your course for editing. For more information, see :ref:`Export a Course` and
:ref:`Import a Course` through Studio.

When you import and export a course, you work with :ref:`.tar.gz files <Work
with the targz file>`.

To duplicate an existing course for a new run, course creators can use the
course re-run option. See :ref:`Re Run a Course`.

.. caution::
  Before exporting and importing a course, ensure that links in the course to
  other course content use the ``/jump_to_id/<unit identifier>`` syntax. If a
  link does not use the ``/jump_to_id/<unit identifier>`` syntax, the link will
  be broken if you export then import the course. For more information, see
  :ref:`Add a Link to a Course Unit`.

There are several reasons you might want to export your course. Examples
follow.

* To save your work.
* To edit the XML in your course directly.
* To create a backup copy of your course, which you can import if you want to
  revert the course back to a previous state.
* To share with the team members of another course.
* To create a copy of your course that you can later import into another course
  instance and customize.

When you export your course, Studio creates a ``.tar.gz`` file that includes
the following course data.

* Course content (all Sections, Subsections, and Units)
* Course structure
* Individual problems
* Pages
* Course assets
* Course settings

The following data is not exported with your course.

* User data
* Course team data
* Discussion data
* Certificates
* Prerequisite course subsection settings

To export your course, follow these steps.

#. From the **Tools** menu, select **Export**.
#. Select **Export Course Content**.

When the export completes you can then access the ``.tar.gz`` file on your
computer.
