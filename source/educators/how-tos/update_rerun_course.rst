Update the New Course after a Re-Run

.. tags:: educator, how-to

When you create a course by re-running another course, you must carefully
review the settings and content of the new course. To assure a quality
experience for learners, be sure to test the course thoroughly before the
course start date. See :ref:`Testing Your Course Content` and
:ref:`Beta_Testing`.

At a minimum, you must make the following changes to prepare the new
course for release.

* Add course team members, including discussion admins, moderators, and
  community TAs. See :ref:`Add Course Team Members` or :ref:`Course_Staffing`.

* Update course-wide dates, including course and enrollment start and end
  dates. See :ref:`Scheduling Your Course`.

* Change the release dates of course sections, subsections, and units. See
  :ref:`Release Dates`.

* Change the due dates of subsections that are part of your grading policy. See
  :ref:`Set the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection`.

* Delete or edit posts on the **Course Updates** page in Studio. See :ref:`Add
  a Course Update`.

* For a course that includes :ref:`learner cohorts<Enabling and Configuring
  Cohorts>`, set up the cohorts and select a strategy for assigning learners to
  the cohorts.

* For a course that includes drag and drop problems, replace any problems
  created prior to April 2016 with the newer drag and drop problem component,
  which is accessible and mobile ready. For more information about enabling the
  new drag and drop problem type and adding these problems to your course, see
  :ref:`drag_and_drop_problem`.

The following additional changes can also improve the experience of learners
who enroll in the new course run.

* Review the files on the **Files & Uploads** page. To update a file that
  contains references to course-related dates, you must complete the
  following steps.

  1. Locate the source file.
  2. Change course-related dates in the file.
  3. Upload the revised version of the file.

  .. note:: If you use the same file name when you upload a revised file,
   links to that file in course components and course handouts will continue to
   work correctly. If you rename a file and then upload it, you must also
   update all links to the original file name. See :ref:`Add Course Handouts`
   or :ref:`Add a Link to a File`.

* Review the staff biographies and other information on the course About page
  and make needed updates. See :ref:`Planning Course Information` and
  :ref:`Planning Course Run Information`.

* Create initial posts for discussion topics and an "introduce yourself"
  post. See :ref:`Discussions`.

* Add initial wiki articles.

* For a course that includes core problem types, including checkbox, text
  input, or math expression input problems, review the
  :ref:`Markdown-style formatting <Simple Editor>` or :ref:`OLX markup
  <Advanced Editor>` of any problems created before September 2016.
  For more information about the updates that you can make to improve the
  accessibility of these problem types, see the `Release Notes
  <http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-release-notes/en/latest/studio_index.html#updates-to-capa-problem-types>`_.

* If your course uses prerequisite course subsections to hide course
  subsections until learners complete other, prerequisite subsections,
  configure the prerequisite course subsections. See
  :ref:`configuring_prerequisite_content`.

* If your course includes instructions for learners, verify that the
  instructions reflect the current user interface of the LMS.

  For example, you could revise a description of the problem **Check** button,
  which was accurate before October 2016, to reflect its new label, **Submit**.

  .. only:: Partners

    Another example of a user interface change is for courses on the edx.org
    website. A new **Help** option was added to the LMS in September 2016 to
    provide access to the *EdX Learner's Guide*. When this option was added,
    the previous **Help** option was renamed **Support**.

For more information about tools and ideas that can help you prepare a course
for launch, see :ref:`Launch`.

.. note::
  Changes you make in the new course have no effect on the original course.
