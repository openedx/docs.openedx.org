Copy and Paste Course Content
#############################

.. note::

   The copy/paste function can currently be used at the component-level of the
   course outline. In other words, it can be used with text blocks, video blocks,
   and problem blocks. In future releases, the copy/paste function will be
   available for other levels of the course outline, including units, subsections
   and sections. 


#. Choose a component that you would like to copy. This may be a text block, a video block or a problem block. 

#. In the “actions” hamburger in the upper right corner of the component block,
   click “Copy to Clipboard”.

#. A notification will appear in the bottom right-hand side of the screen indicating the copy is complete. It should only take a few seconds.

#. Navigate to the unit where you'd like to paste the component. This may be in the same course or a different course.

#. Click “paste component”.

.. note::

    The copy/paste feature does not support the ability to sync between
    components. Once a component is pasted, it functions as an independent
    entity and any changes made to the new version will not be reflected
    in the original.
