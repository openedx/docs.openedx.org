Add Course Creators

.. tags:: educator, how-to


When you create a new course in Studio, you are automatically an Admin in the course, meaning you can create and add course creators, in addition to being able to create and manage course content.

.. Note:: You must be an Admin to add or remove other course creators.


#. Open the course in Studio.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Course Team**.

#. Click **New Team Member**.

#. Enter the user's email address and click **Add User**.

  .. Note:: Users must be registered on the Open edX site before you can add them as a course creator.

The user is now listed as staff and can use Studio to modify the course.

You can also make the user an Admin.
