You can enroll and unenroll learners from the instructor dashboard. See :ref:`Enrollment_Requirements` for more information.

***************************
Enroll Learners in a Course
***************************

To enroll learners or course team members, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Membership**.

#. In the **Batch Enrollment** section of the page, enter the username or email
   address of the learner, or enter multiple names or addresses separated by
   commas or new lines.

   You can copy and paste data from a CSV file of email addresses. However,
   note that this feature is better suited to courses with smaller enrollments,
   rather than courses with massive enrollments.

#. For **Role of the users being enrolled**, select the role of the learner.

   * If the learner is a member of the course staff, select **Partner**.
   * If the learner is not a member of the course staff, select **Learner**.

   .. note::
    All of the users that you enroll at one time must have the same role. If
    you have some users who are partners and others who are learners, you must
    complete two batch enrollments.

#. In the **Enter the reason why the students are to be manually enrolled or
   unenrolled** field, enter a specific, detailed reason why you want to
   enroll these learners.

#. To streamline the course enrollment process, leave **Auto Enroll** selected.

#. To send learners an email message, leave **Notify students by email**
   selected.

#. Select **Enroll**.

You can view or download a list of the people who are enrolled in the course.
For more information, see :ref:`Learner Data`.

.. note::
 When you enroll learners in a course, all learners are automatically enrolled
 in the audit enrollment track. For more information about course enrollment
 tracks, see :term:`Enrollment Track`.

.. _unenroll_student:

*******************************
Unenroll Learners from a Course
*******************************

You can remove learners from a course by unenrolling them. To prevent learners
from re-enrolling, course enrollment must also be closed. You use Studio to set
the **Enrollment End Date** for the course to a date in the past. For more
information, see :ref:`Course Schedule` and :ref:`Set Course Schedule`.

.. note:: Unenrollment does not delete data for a learner. An unenrolled
   learner's state remains in the database and is reinstated if the learner
   does re-enroll.

To unenroll learners, you supply the email addresses of enrolled learners.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Membership**.

#. In the **Batch Enrollment** section of the page, enter a username or an
   email address, or multiple names or addresses separated by commas or new
   lines.

#. In the **Enter the reason why the students are to be manually enrolled or
   unenrolled** field, enter a specific, detailed reason why you want to
   unenroll these learners.

#. To send learners an email message, leave **Notify students by email**
   selected.

   .. note:: The **Auto Enroll** option has no effect when you select
     **Unenroll**.

#. Select **Unenroll**. The course is no longer listed on the learners'
   **Current Courses** dashboards, and the learners can no longer access the
   course content or contribute to discussions or the wiki.
