Manage Permissions on a Taxonomy
################################

.. note::
    On import, new taxonomies are not enabled by default.
    
    Once a taxonomy is enabled for an organization, it will appear in all courses in that organization.

#. Find the taxonomy you wish to enable from the Taxonomy Listing page, click
   the 3-dot menu and choose :guilabel:`Manage Organizations`.

#. Type the name of the organization you wish to enable for in the dropdown
   field, or scroll through the list of all orgs.

#. Add as many organizations as you would like, OR, check the box to assign to
   all organizations. If your instance is a single-organization instance, check
   :guilabel:`Assign to all organizations`.

   the tag drawer. You should see the taxonomy and its tags available in the Tag
   Drawer.
