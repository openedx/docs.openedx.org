Add and delete tags on course content
#####################################

.. note::

     Tags can be added to course content from three places in Studio: From the
     Course Outline Page, from the Unit Page, and from individual Component
     Blocks.

.. note::

     Tags can be added to all four levels of the course outline: Sections,
     Subsections, Units and Component Blocks. Tags do not inherit from one level
     of the course to another. In other words, when a tag is added to a unit, it
     is not added to the subsection that the unit is in. Likewise, if a tag is
     added to a unit, it is not added to the components within. 
     
     For instructions on how to add tags to full courses, see
     :ref:`add-tags-to-a-course`
