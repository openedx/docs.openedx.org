To create a proctored exam, you modify the Proctored Exam Settings in Studio
to enable proctored exams, and then you modify the settings of a subsection to
specify that the subsection is a proctored exam.

To enable proctored exams in your course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, then select **Proctored Exam Settings**.

#. Locate the **Enable Proctored Exams** policy key. The default for this field
   is to be unchecked, meaning that proctored exams are not enabled.

#. Check the setting to enable proctored exams.

#. Select **Submit**. You can now create proctored exams in your course.

After you enable proctored exams for your course, you can create a proctored exam or a practice proctored exam.
