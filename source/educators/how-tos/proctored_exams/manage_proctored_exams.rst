.. _Respond to Learner Concerns about Proctored Exams:

Accommodate Learners with Disabilities
**************************************

A learner may request and qualify for a disability accommodation to a
proctored exam, such as an additional time allowance or an exam policy
exception allowing a personal care assistant in the room.

.. note::
  Make sure the learner who has requested special accommodations, including
  additional time, does not start taking the proctored exam before you set up
  the accommodation.

  If you need to allow more time for the learner, see :ref:`Grant
  Learners More Time for a Timed Exam`.

To make a special policy accommodation for learners, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Special Exams**.

#. Expand **Allowance Section**.

#. Select **Add Allowance**.

   The **Add a New Allowance** dialog box opens.

#. For **Username** or **Email**, enter all the learners' emails/usernames seperated by a comma that you wish to add an exception for.

#. For **Select Exam Type**, select **Proctored Exams**

#. For **Select Exams**, click on the desired exams you want to add an exception for.

#. For **Allowance Type**, select **Review Policy Exception**.

#. Add a description of the allowance, such as the following example.

   ``Learner has a disability. Allow one additional person in the room.``

#. Select **Create Allowance**.

When you have set up the allowance, let the learner know that their special
allowance has been granted.

When the proctoring service reviews the learner's proctored exam results, the
reviewer takes the special allowance into account.

Resuming Proctored Exams in an Error State
******************************************

If a learner encounters an error while taking a proctored exam and cannot
continue, their exam attempt can be manually resumed with their answers and
time remaining saved.

The procedures for allowing learners to resume a proctored exam and a timed
exam are the same. To allow learners to resume an exam, see :ref:`Resuming
an Exam in an Error State`.

.. _Requests for Retaking a Proctored Exam:

Allow Learners to Retake a Proctored Exam
******************************************

If a learner needs to retake a proctored exam, you can clear
their existing exam attempt and allow them to retake the exam.

The procedures for allowing learners to retake a proctored exam and a timed
exam are the same. To allow learners to retake an exam, see :ref:`Allow
Learners to Retake a Timed Exam`.
