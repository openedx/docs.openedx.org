Create a Proctored Exam with Proctortrack
#########################################

.. tags:: educator, how-to

After you enable proctored exams with Proctortrack for your course, you can
create proctored exams.

To create a proctored exam for Proctortrack, you first create a single
Onboarding exam subsection in your course, and then create one or more
proctored exam subsections.

The Onboarding exam is a practice proctored experience which ensures the
learner's computer passes system requirements and establishes the learner's
identity with Verificient by creating an onboarding profile.

Creating an Onboarding Subsection
*********************************

Proctortrack requires all learners to complete an onboarding process before
they take a proctored exam. In the onboarding process, learners download and
install the necessary client software and verify their identity with
Proctortrack.

.. note:: Onboarding includes a mandatory identity verification step which
   establishes an identity baseline with Verificient. This is required to gain
   access to the first Proctored Exam, and can take 5+ business days for
   learners to complete, so we recommend you:

   * Create an Onboarding subsection in the first section of any course using
     Proctortrack proctoring, as described below.

   * Add in-course messaging that completing Onboarding early is important.

   * Nudge learners who have not yet completed Onboarding a week before the
     first proctored exam.

To set up Proctortrack onboarding for your course, follow these steps.

#. Add and :ref:`develop a subsection <Manage Course Subsections>` as you
   would any other subsection.

   #. Change the name to something clear to learners, like “Proctortrack
      Onboarding”.

   #. As in the note above, add instructions to learners, explaining why it is
      important to complete Onboarding early.

   #. Position the Onboarding subsection at an early stage in your course - we
      recommend positioning it in the first section.

#. Select the **Configure** icon for the subsection.

#. The **Settings** dialog box opens to the **Basic** tab.

#. In the **Grading** section, set the :ref:`assignment type and due date<Set
   the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection>` for the subsection.

#. Select the **Advanced** tab, and then locate the **Set as a Special Exam**
   section.

#. Select the exam type to **Onboarding**.

   .. note::
      Once the exam content has been released to students, the special
      exam type cannot be modified.

#. Select **Save**.
