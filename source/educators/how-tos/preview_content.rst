To preview draft content and see how it would appear to members of different
groups when it is released, follow these steps.

#. From a unit page in the **Course Outline** in Studio, select **Preview**.

   A separate browser tab opens for the course in the LMS.

#. In the LMS, select one of the **View this course as** options, as described
   in :ref:`Roles for Viewing Course Content`.

The course view refreshes to present course content as it is currently
configured in Studio, and as a learner in the selected group would see it.

.. note:: If you use randomized content blocks in your course, you cannot
   preview unpublished units that contain content from randomized content
   blocks, because the randomized content is not assigned until after the unit
   is published. For information about viewing the actual content that has
   been assigned to a particular learner from a randomized content block in a
   live course, see :ref:`Specific Student View`.
