inappropriate or off-topic material, should be edited quickly to remove text,
images, or links.

   discussion topics, apply a filter, or search to locate the post.

#. For the post or for the response or comment that you want to edit, select
   the "More" icon and then **Edit**.

#. Remove the problematic portion of the message, or replace it with standard
   text such as "[REMOVED BY MODERATOR]".

   violates the honor code."
