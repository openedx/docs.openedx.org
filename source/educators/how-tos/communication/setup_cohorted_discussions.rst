.. NOTE: This is a how-to in that it answers a very specific "how" to set up discussions in a cohorted course, even though it does that by pointing to other docs.

In courses that use cohorts, in addition to :ref:`discussion
topics<Discussions>` that are by default shared by all learners, you can create
divided discussion topics, within which learners interact only with other
members of their cohort.

For information about divided discussions, see :ref:`About Divided
Discussions`.

For information about managing and moderating discussions, see :ref:`Managing
Divided Discussion Topics` and :ref:`Moderating_discussions`.
