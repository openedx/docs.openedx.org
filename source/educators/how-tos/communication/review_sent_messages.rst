          and message for an email message, and an option to Copy Email
          to Editor.

   Email to Editor**. The dialog box closes and you can edit the text, links,
   and formatting that were duplicated into the **Subject** and **Message**
   fields.

   When you create a message by copying a previously-sent message, be sure to
   review and test it thoroughly before you send it to all course participants.
