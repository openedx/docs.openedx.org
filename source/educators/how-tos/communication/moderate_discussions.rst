If a learner repeatedly misuses course discussions despite being warned, you
can unenroll that learner from the course. For more information, see
:ref:`unenroll_student`. The learner cannot re-enroll in the course if the
enrollment period for the course is over.

2. On the Provider Selection page, click 'Next' to leave provider unchanged.

2. On the Settings page, scroll down to the **Discussion Restrictions** field.

3. You have three options for restricting discussions:

   * **Off**: Allow discussions to be posted at any time.
   * **On**: Restrict discussions to the specified date range.
   * **Scheduled**: Restrict discussions by adding one or more blackout date ranges. Discussion posts will not be allowed during the blackout dates.

.. note:: The dates and times that you enter are in Coordinated Universal
   Time (UTC), not in your local time zone. You might want to verify that you
   have specified the times that you intend by using a time zone converter.
