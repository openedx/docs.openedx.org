 .. note::
   Courses on edx.org must use Publisher to re-run courses `Pub Creating a Course Run`_.

To use the import and export options to re-run a course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, open the course that you want to re-run.

#. :ref:`Export your course <Export a Course>`.

#. In Studio, :ref:`create a new course <Creating a New Course>`.

   .. note::
     You must have course creation privileges to create a new course. If you do
     not have course creation privileges, contact a member of the course team
     who has these privileges, or your organization's administrator.

#. In the new course, :ref:`import the content from the previous course <Import
   a Course>`.

#. After the import operation is complete, :ref:`review and update the settings
   and content <Update the New Course>` for the new course.
