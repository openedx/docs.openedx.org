If you select the **Full Profile** option, you can add social media icons on
your profile that link to your personal Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn account
pages.

To add links to your social media accounts to your profile, follow these steps.

#. At the top of any page, select **Account** from the dropdown menu icon next
   to your username.

#. On the **Account Settings** page, under **Social Media Links**, enter
   either your username or the URL to the profile page for each social media
   account that you want to add to your profile.

   For example, if your Facebook username is ``John Doe``, you can enter ``https://www.facebook.com/johndoe``.

   For LinkedIn, note that your username might include numbers. For example,
   if the URL of your LinkedIn profile page is ``https://www.linkedin.com/in
   /firstname-lastname-123456/``, your LinkedIn username is ``firstname-
   lastname-123456``.

The site saves your changes when you click outside the text field.

When you view your profile, icons for the social media icons that you added
links for appear below your username. Other learners or course team members
can click those icons to visit your social media account page.
