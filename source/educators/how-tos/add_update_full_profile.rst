.. note:: You must specify your year of birth on the **Account Settings** page
   before you can share a full profile. If you are under 13 years of age, you
   can share only a Limited Profile.

If you create a full profile, you share the following information in
addition to your username and profile image.

* Your full name.

* Your location.

* Your language.

* A paragraph about yourself. You might include your interests, goals, or
  other information that you want to share. This paragraph can contain up to
  300 characters.

* Links to your personal social media accounts.

To add or update your profile, follow these steps.

#. At the top of any page, select **Dashboard** from the dropdown menu icon next
   to your username, then select the **Profile** tab.

#. In the header area of your profile page, for **Profile Visibility**, select
   **Full Profile**.

#. (optional) Add a profile image.

   Your image must be a .gif, .jpg, or .png file that is less than 1 MB in
   size. If you do not add an image, the placeholder image appears as your
   profile image.

   #. Move your cursor over the placeholder image, and click **Upload an
      image**.

   #. In the file navigation window, select the image file that you want to
      use as your profile image, and then click **Open**.

   To change or remove your profile image, move your cursor over your image,
   and then select either **Change image** or **Remove**. When you remove your
   profile image, the placeholder image appears as your profile image.

#. On your profile page, move your cursor over the information that you want
   to change.

#. Click inside the field to choose an option from the list, or enter text.

The site saves your changes automatically.

.. note:: If you change your profile type from **Full Profile** to **Limited
   Profile**, your full name, location, language, and descriptive paragraph
   are no longer visible on your profile page. However, this information is
   saved, and becomes visible again to other learners and course teams if you
   change your profile back to **Full Profile**.
