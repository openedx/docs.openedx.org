OLX (open learning XML) is the XML-based standard used to build courses for the
Open edX Platform.

With OLX, you can:

* Move content between different Open edX instances, either by using the
  ``.tar.gz`` export of OLX that Studio provides, or by hand-writing OLX and
  compiling it into a ``.tar.gz`` file (see :ref:`Work with the targz File`).
* Create course content outside of Open edX Studio, including by conversion from
  other content formats (note: the `cc2olx converter
  <https://github.com/openedx/cc2olx>`_ can be used to convert Common
  Cartridge exports into OLX).

**************

OLX is based on XML. XML, or Extensible Markup Language, is a set of rules
for creating documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-
readable.

To work with OLX, you should have a strong understanding of XML. This
document presumes you understand XML and can use tools to create and edit XML
files.

For a primer on XML, see the `Wikipedia XML entry`_ .
