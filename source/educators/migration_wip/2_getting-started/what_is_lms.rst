What Is the LMS?
****************

The LMS is the web-based tool where you view the courses you have created in
Studio.

If you have not created a course, see :ref:`Creating a New Course`.

#. In Studio, locate your course on your dashboard and open your course.

#. On the **Course Outline** page, select **View Live**.

   Your course enrollment page opens in a new browser tab.

#. Select **Enroll** to enroll in your course. After you enroll in your course,
   it opens in the LMS.

To continue working on your course, return to the browser tab that shows
Studio.
