.. note::
  **This information applies only to courses that run on the edx.org site.**
  For information about adding videos to courses that run on Edge, see
  :ref:`Add a Video to an Edge Course`.

For courses on edx.org, you add the following information to the video
component:

* A display name for the component.
* The video ID that the upload process automatically creates for your video. To
  find the video ID, see :ref:`Copy the Video ID`.
* The transcript for your video, for videos with non-integrated transcripts.

.. _Copy the Video ID:

=================
Copy the Video ID
=================

To copy the video ID, follow these steps.

#. Open the course in Studio.

#. On the **Content** menu, select **Videos**.

#. Locate the video that you want to include in the course.

#. Click on the three dot menu, the select "Copy video ID".  The video ID
   is assigned when you upload a video.

Note that the course team can add a video to their course as soon as the
unique video ID is visible on the **Videos** page. However, for a video to
play successfully, the status for the file must be “Ready”. Processing
takes 24 hours to complete for all encodings and all video hosting sites.

You can also :ref:`download a report<Reporting Video Status>` of all uploaded
videos. The report includes the video ID for every uploaded file.

  **This information applies only to courses that run on the edx.org site.**
  For information about adding videos to courses that run on Edge, see
  :ref:`Add a Video to an Edge Course`.

To add a video and its transcript to an edx.org course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, locate the unit that you want, and then select **Video** under
   **Add New Component**.

#. Select the **pencil icon** in the top left hand corner, and enter the name
   that you want learners to see for this video as the Component Display Name.

   This name appears as a heading above the video in the LMS, and it identifies
   the video for you in reporting and analytics systems. If you do not enter a
   display name, the platform specifies “Video” for you. Clicking the “Check”
   icon will save your changes, the “X” icon will discard them.

#. Under Video Source, in the **Video ID** field, enter the Video ID, or **Video
   URL** fields, enter the streaming media link, or video file URL.

   .. note::
      When you add the video ID, you do not need to add values to the **Video
      URL** or **Fallback Video** fields. The URLs that are associated with the
      video ID override any existing values in other fields.

#. Optionally, you can set more options for the video. For a
   description of each option, see :ref:`Video Settings`.

#. Select **Save** to save the video component.
