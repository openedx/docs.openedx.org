Course Team Roles
*****************

To give team members access to Studio, and the instructor dashboard in the LMS
you assign one of these course team roles to them.

* Staff

* Limited Staff

* Admin

You can assign these privileged roles when you work in either the LMS or
Studio. The people who have these roles can work on your course in Studio and
the LMS. For more information about assigning roles to team members in Studio,
see :ref:`Add Course Team Members <Add Course Team Members>`.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course or to moderate
and manage its discussions by assigning other roles in the LMS. Beta testers
and discussion team members must be enrolled in your course, but they do not
need to have the Staff or Admin role. For more information, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing <Beta_Testing>` and :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles <Assigning_discussion_roles>`.

immediately, and can also use the LMS. For more information about
assigning roles while you run your course, see :ref:`Course_Staffing <Course_Staffing>`.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course and to
moderate and manage its discussions by assigning other LMS roles. The beta
