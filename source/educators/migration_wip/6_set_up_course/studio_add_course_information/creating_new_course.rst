To create and run a course, you can either create an entirely new course in
Studio, or you can re-run an existing course. For more information about re-
running a course, see :ref:`Rerun a Course <Rerun a Course>`.

You can also :ref:`export<Export a Course>` and :ref:`import<Import a Course>`
courses as XML files. You can do this when you need to back up a course or edit
the course in XML.

   .. note::
    This process applies to courses on the edX Edge site. If your course will
    run on edx.org, see `Pub Creating and Announcing a Course`_.

To create a course, follow these steps.

#. Sign in to Studio.

#. Select **New Course**.

#. Enter the following information about your course.

   .. important::
    The values that you enter for the organization, course number, and course
    run cannot be edited after you create your course.

   * For **Course Name**, enter the title of your course. For example, the
     name might be "Sets, Maps, and Symmetry Groups". Use title capitalization
     for the course title, and normal spacing and punctuation.

   * For **Organization**, you enter the identifier for your organization. Do
     not include spaces or special characters.

   * For **Course Number**, you enter both a subject abbreviation and a number.
     For example, for public health course number 207, enter ``PH207``. For
     math course 101x, enter ``Math101x``. Do not include spaces or special
     characters in the course number.

     .. note:: If your course will be public, be sure to include the "x".
        If it is exclusively an on campus offering, do not include the "x".

   * For **Course Run**, you enter the term in which your course will run. For
     example, enter 2014SOND or T2_2014. Do not include spaces or special
     characters.

     The value that you enter for the run does not affect the course start date
     that you define for the course. For more information, see :ref:`Scheduling
     Your Course <Scheduling
     Your Course>`.

   The organization, course number, and course run values that you enter are
   used to create the URL for your course. Because URLs do not have an
   unlimited length, the total number of characters that you enter for these
   values must be 65 or fewer.

#. Select **Create**.

   The :ref:`Course Outline<Developing Your Course Outline>` page opens. You
   can start developing course content. For more information, see
   :ref:`Getting Started with Course Content Development <Getting Started with Course Content Development>`.

.. _Edit Your Course:

   .. note::
    This process applies to courses on the edX Edge site. If your course will
    run on edx.org, see `Pub Creating and Announcing a Course`_.

After you create a course, the course opens in Studio automatically and you can
begin editing. Your next steps might include adding other :ref:`course team
members<Add Course Team Members>`, setting the course :ref:`start and end
dates<Scheduling Your Course>`, or developing the :ref:`course
outline<Developing Your Course Outline>`.

When you return to Studio later, your **My Courses** dashboard page lists
the courses that you created as well as any courses for which you have course
team privileges.

.. note::
  After the end date for a course has passed, the course moves to the
  **Archived Courses** tab on the Studio dashboard. If the course that you want
  to edit is not visible on the **Courses** tab, look for the course on the
  **Archived Courses** tab.

To edit a course, select the course name. The Studio **Course Outline** page
appears.

.. _Change the Course Title or Number:

  *******************

  To make certain information about your course available to entities such as
  customer relationship management (CRM) software, a marketing site, or other
  external systems, follow these steps.

  #. Create a JSON dictionary that contains the metadata that you want to add.
  #. In Studio, open your course, and then select **Advanced Settings** on the
     **Settings** menu.
  #. In the **Other Course Settings** field, paste your JSON dictionary.

  In case you can't find the **Other Course Settings** field in
  the **Advanced Settings**, set ``ENABLE_OTHER_COURSE_SETTINGS`` to ``true``
  under ``FEATURES`` in ``/edx/etc/studio.yml`` and restart Studio.
