Course Number Guidelines

Course numbers have the following guidelines.

* Course numbers can have a maximum of 10 characters.
* Characters can be letters, numbers, or periods.
* If a course consists of several modules, the course number can have an ending
  such as .1x or .2x.

  The number that you specify when you create your course becomes part of the
  course URL. The course URL cannot be changed. However, if you want to change
  the way that your course number appears in Studio and the LMS, see
  :ref:`Change the Course Number <Change the Course Number>`.
