The `edX Help Center for Learners`_ includes topics to help you understand how
to use the Open edX learning management system. On edx.org, the Help Center is also available from within the learning experience by selecting the **Help** menu from within your edX dashboard.

If you have a question about something you encounter in an edX course, try
these options for getting an answer.

.. note::
  If you find an error or mistake in a course, contact the course staff by
  adding a post in the :ref:`course discussions <Discussions>`.

* Check the **Course** page in the course. Course teams use this page to post
  updates about the course, which can include explanations about course
  content, reminders about when graded assignments are due, or announcements
  for upcoming events or milestones.

* Look for an "Introduction", "Overview", or "Welcome" section in the course
  content. In the first section in the course, course teams often include
  general information about how the course works and what you can expect, and
  also what they expect from you, in the first section in the course.

* Participate in the :ref:`course discussions <Discussions>`. Other learners
  might be able to answer your question, or might have the same question
  themselves. If you encounter an unfamiliar word, phrase, or abbreviation,
  such as "finger exercise" or "board work", search for it on the
  **Discussion** page, or post a question about it yourself. Your comments and
  questions give the course team useful feedback for improving the course.

* Investigate other resources. Some courses have a `SFD Wiki`_,
  which can be a good source of information. Outside of the course, a
  course-specific social media (ex: Facebook group) or messaging community (ex: Discord) might be available for
  learners to share information.
