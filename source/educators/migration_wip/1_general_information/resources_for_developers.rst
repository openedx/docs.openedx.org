The `Open edX Portal`_ is the entry point for new contributors.

The edX Engineering team maintains an `open Confluence wiki`_, which
provides insights into the plans, projects, and questions that the edX Open
Source team is working on with the community.

The `edx-tools`_ wiki lists publicly shared tools for working with the edX
platform, including scripts and helper utilities.
