Adding Course Updates and Handouts
##################################

You can create course updates and handouts in Studio.

Course updates are communications, especially a welcome message, that learners
see at the top of the **Course** page when they enter the course. A welcome
message is an important way of making each learner feel personally welcomed to
the course, and of providing orienting information that helps learners succeed
with the course.

After learners have read the welcome message, they can dismiss the message.
The message is automatically dismissed seven days after the learner first
views it if the learner doesn't actively dismiss it first. Learners can access
the dismissed message and any other updates from the **Updates** link in the
sidebar on the **Course** page.

Handouts are links to files that you upload in Studio, for example, a PDF
version of the course syllabus, or an article that you want learners to read.
Learners see the list of course handouts under **Handouts** in the sidebar.

On the **Updates** page in Studio, you see the list of updates sorted in the
order that they were created (most recent at the top of the list). You can
edit or delete a previous update using the pencil and trash icons. If you
create a new update, learners do not see the update on the **Course** page
unless it has the latest chronological date of all existing updates.

  by clicking on the button located at the top right hand corner of the page.
  Additionally, you can edit a previous update by selecting the pencil icon
  or delete an update by clicking on the trash icon. You can also add a course
  handout by clicking on the pencil icon on the right side of the page.

To add a course update, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Updates** from the **Content** menu.
#. Create your update in the text editor that opens.

     .. note::
        To make sure that your announcements are accessible, if you use
        headings inside an announcement, make sure that you use only level 6
        headings. The structure of the course **Course** page uses
        heading levels 1-5.

   * Specify a date for this update. By default, today's date is already
     entered. You can change the date using the calendar tool, or by entering
     some other valid date.

#. Select **Post**.

   Your new update becomes available to learners immediately. If the update
   has the latest chronological date, it is shown to learners on the
   **Course** page, otherwise the update appears on the **Updates** page.

    #. Optionally, choose whether to send a notification about your update to
       the edX mobile app.

      * Learners can choose to turn off notifications for individual courses or
        for all courses. The **Course** page continues to show updates.
      * Updates appear on the **Course** page, even if you do not send
        notifications.
