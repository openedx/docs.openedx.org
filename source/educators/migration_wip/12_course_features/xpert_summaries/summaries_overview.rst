  Xpert Unit Summaries will summarize Text and Video Transcript text
  for learners at the end of a unit to reinforce the information that
  was contained in the unit.

  When enabled by the course team, learners only need to click the
  **Summarize button** at the bottom of the unit to see a condensed
  summary of the content.

  Learners can learn more about how the summary was generated by
  clicking the **information icon below the summary.**

  Learners can leave feedback about the summary using the **thumbs up
  and down** icons at the bottom right of the summary card. This
  feedback is only shared with edX for the purpose of improving the
  tool.

  .. note:: Not all pages have the Summarize button, as the system automatically selects which units are eligible for summarization based on the amount of text in the unit.
