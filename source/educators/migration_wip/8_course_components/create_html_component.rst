***********************
Text Component Overview
***********************

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to
create web pages. Web browsers present HTML code in a more readable format.

When students see text and images in your course, they are seeing HTML code
that is formatted and presented by their browsers. For more information about
HTML, see `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>`_.

===============
Text Components
===============

Text components are the basic building blocks of your course content. You use
Text components to add and format text, links, images, and more. You can work
with your Text components in a "visual" or WYSIWYG editor that hides the HTML
code details, or in a "raw" editor that requires you to mark up your content.

.. note::
 Review :ref:`Developing Your Course Index` and :ref:`Best Practices for HTML
 Markup` before you start working with Text components.


.. _Options for Editing Text Components:

***********************************
Options for Editing Text Components
***********************************

You can use two different editing interfaces to work with a Text component.

* :ref:`The Visual Editor`

  With the visual editor you create, edit, and format content in a word
  processing-like interface, without using HTML markup directly. With the
  visual editor, you can more easily format your content, and add links and
  images.

  The visual editor includes an **HTML** option for you to review the
  HTML markup and make small formatting changes to your content. However, this
  HTML option does not provide the detailed control you can get with the raw
  HTML editor, nor does it support custom formatting or scripts.

  If you add a Text component and select **Text**, when you select **Edit**
  the visual editor opens by default.

* :ref:`The Raw HTML Editor`

  If you prefer to mark up your content directly with HTML markup, you can use
  the raw HTML editor. If you need to include custom formatting or scripts in
  your content, you must use the raw HTML editor.

  If you add a Text component and select **Raw HTML**, when you select
  **Edit** the raw HTML editor opens by default.

  There is no way to switch between the Visual Editor and the Raw HTML editor
  once one is selected.

.. note::
    If you copy text from another source and paste it into either the visual or
    raw HTML editor, be sure to proofread the result carefully. Some
    applications automatically change quotation marks and apostrophes from the
    "straight" version to the "smart" or "curly" version. Both editors require
    "straight" quotation marks and apostrophes.

.. _The Visual Editor:

=================
The Visual Editor
=================

The visual editor provides a "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) interface
that allows you to format text by selecting options at the top
of the editor.

The following image shows callouts for the editing options and is followed by
descriptions.

.. image:: ../images/HTML_VisualView_Toolbar.png
  :alt: An image of the visual editor toolbar, with numbers next to each of the
   formatting buttons.
  :width: 600

#. Arrows that perform undo/redo actions.

#. Select a formatting style for the selected text, such as paragraph,
   ``preformatted`` (monospace), or a heading level.

   .. note::
     The available heading levels in the Text component editor begin with
     heading 2 (``<h2>``). Text components are part of a complete page, and
     elements outside the Text component use heading level 1 by default.
     Because tools such as screen readers use heading levels to navigate
     through pages, using heading level 1 inside a Text component can
     interfere with the functionality of these tools.

#. Format the selected text in bold, or remove this formatting. The editor
   inserts ``<strong>`` tags around the selected text.

#. Format the selected text in italics, or remove this formatting. The editor
   inserts ``<em>`` tags around the selected text.

#. Underline the selected text, or remove this formatting. The editor encloses
   the selected text in the tag ``<span style="text-decoration: underline;">``.

#. Change the color of the selected text. The editor encloses the selected text
   in the tag ``<span style="color: color-hex-code;">``.

#. Change the background color of the selected text. The editor encloses the
   selected text in the tag ``<span style="background-color: color-hex-code;">``.

#. Align text and images to the left. The editor adds ``style="text-align:
   left;"`` to the ``<p>`` tags that surround the text.

#. Center text and images. The editor adds ``style="text-align: center;"`` to
   the ``<p>`` tags that surround the text.

#. Align text and images to the right. The editor adds ``style="text-align:
   right;"`` to the ``<p>`` tags that surround the text.

#. Justify text and images. The editor adds ``style="text-align: justify;"`` to
   the ``<p>`` tags that surround the text.

#. Create a bulleted list, or remove this formatting. The editor inserts
   ``<ul>`` tags around the selected text, and encloses each paragraph in
   ``<li>`` tags.

#. Create a numbered list, or remove this formatting. The editor inserts
   ``<ol>`` tags around the selected text, and encloses each paragraph in
   ``<li>`` tags.

#. Decrease and increase the indentation of the selected paragraph.

#. Insert an image at the cursor. For more information, see :ref:`Add an Image
   to a Text Component`.

#. Create a hypertext link from the selected text. For more information, see
   :ref:`Add a Link in a Text Component`.

#. Remove a hypertext link from the selected text.

#. Format the selected paragraph as a blockquote. The editor inserts
   ``<blockquote>`` tags around the selected text, which is then displayed as a
   separate indented paragraph.

#. Format the selected text as a code block, or remove this formatting. The
   editor inserts ``<code>`` tags around the selected text, which is then
   displayed in a monospace font.

#. The table toolbar icon lets you drop in a table component and selecting a
   given cell lets you create, remove, or adjust rows and columns.

#. You can easily add emoticons to your text content. This can be a way to break
   up long stretches of content.

#. We have introduced a way to to include special characters into your text
   content, including mathematical and symbolic elements.

#. Inject a horizontal line in the highlighted content.

#. Clear formatting button which removes all font formatting from the selected
   text.  This does not remove paragraph formatting (e.g. blockquote).

#. Review the HTML markup.

#. Accessibility Checker, which allows you to check HTML in the editor for various
   accessibility problems. For more information, see :doc:`../5_accessibility/accessibility_checker`.


.. note::
  The visual editor is not available for :ref:`course handouts <Adding Course
  Updates and Handouts>`.

.. _Work with HTML code:

Review HTML Markup in the Visual Editor
***************************************

To review the HTML markup added to content in the visual editor, select
**HTML** from the visual editor's toolbar. The HTML source code editor opens.

.. image:: ../images/HTML_source_code.png
 :alt: The HTML source code editor for the visual editor in Studio, showing
     HTML with markup.
 :width: 600

You can edit text and the HTML markup in this editor. However, you cannot add
custom styles or scripts in this editor. To do this, you must use the
:ref:`raw HTML editor<The Raw HTML Editor>` instead.

Select **Save** to return to the visual editor. The visual editor attempts to
correct any problems with the markup that you entered. For example, if you do
not provide a close paragraph tag, the editor adds the tag for you.

You can then continue working in the visual editor.

.. warning::
 Selecting **OK** in the source code editor does not save your changes to the
 Text component. To save your changes and close the component, select **Save**
 in the visual editor. If you select **Cancel**, the changes you made in the
 HTML source code editor are discarded.

.. _The Raw HTML Editor:

===================
The Raw HTML Editor
===================

The raw HTML editor is a text editor. It does not offer a toolbar with
formatting options.

.. image:: ../images/raw_html_editor.png
 :alt: The raw HTML editor, showing example HTML.
 :width: 600

When you use this editor, you must supply valid HTML. The raw HTML editor does
not validate your HTML code. If you use this editor, you should thoroughly test
the HTML content in your course.

.. important::
 When you add a heading to a Text component, make sure that you use only
 heading level 2 ``<h2>`` through heading level 6 ``<h6>``. Text components are
 part of a complete page, and elements outside the Text component use heading
 level 1 by default. Because tools such as screen readers use heading
 levels to navigate through pages, using heading level 1 inside a Text
 component can interfere with the functionality of these tools.

.. _Create a Text Component:

***********************
Create a Text Component
***********************

#. Under **Add New Component**, select **Text**.

#. Select the template.

   The rest of these instructions assume that you selected **Text**, which
   creates an empty Text component with the :ref:`visual editor<The Visual
   Editor>` selected.

   An empty Text component appears at the bottom of the unit, and the Text
   component opens in the visual editor.

#. Enter and format your content. You can :ref:`review the HTML markup<Work
   with HTML code>`.

#. To enter a display name for the component, select the Pencil icon next to
   the title in the top left corner of the visual editor. Changing the
   display name from it's default value to a unique, descriptive display name
   can help you and your learners identify course content quickly and
   accurately. If no title is present, the platform shows "Text" as the name
   of the component when in Studio.

#. Select **Save**.

When you use the visual editor, you can also perform the following tasks.

* :ref:`Add a Link in a Text Component`
* :ref:`Add an Image to a Text Component`
* :ref:`Import LaTeX Code<import latex code>`


.. _Text Component Templates:

========================
Text Component Templates
========================

When you create a Text component, you select from a list of templates and
editor types, including the following:

* Text
* Announcement
* IFrame Tool
* Raw HTML

The **Text** template loads the Visual Editor with no pre-canned text.

The **Announcement** and the **IFrame Tool** templates load the Visual Editor
with pre-canned text that instructs the user how to format Announcements,
or how to use IFrames.

The **Raw HTML** editor type uses the raw HTML editor by default. All other
options use the visual editor by default. There is no way to switch between
Visual and Raw editor types once selected.

.. _Add a Link in a Text Component:

******************************
Add a Link in a Text Component
******************************

When you use the visual editor, to add a link to a website, course unit, or
file in a Text component, you work with the **Insert link** dialog box.

For more information, see the following tasks.

* :ref:`Add a Link to a Website`
* :ref:`Add a Link to a Course Unit`
* :ref:`Add a Link to a File`

.. _Add a Link to a Website:

=======================
Add a Link to a Website
=======================

#. Select the text that you want to use as the link text.

#. Select the link icon in the toolbar.

#. In the **Insert/Edit link** dialog box, enter the URL of the website that
   is the destination for your link in the **URL** field.

#. If you want the link to open in a new window, select the dropdown arrow
   next to the **Open Link In...** field, and then select **New Window**.
   If not, you can leave the default value.

#. Select **OK**.

#. Save the Text component.

#. To test the link, select **View Live Version** or **Preview**. When the unit
   opens in the LMS, select the linked text and verify that the correct website
   opens.

.. _Add a Link to a Course Unit:

===========================
Add a Link to a Course Unit
===========================

.. note::
  When you create a link to another component, the unit of that destination
  component must be published for the link to work.

#. Obtain the location ID of the unit you want to link to.

   #. In Studio, open the page for the unit that you want to link to in Studio,
      and then locate **Unit Location** in the right pane.

   #. Under **Unit Location**, select and copy the alphanumeric text in the
      **Location ID** field.

      .. image:: ../images/UnitIdentifier.png
       :alt: The **Unit Location** area in the right pane of a unit page, with
           the unit's location ID circled.

#. Open the Text component where you want to add the link.

#. Select the text that you want to make into the link.

#. Select the link icon in the toolbar.

#. In the **Insert link** dialog box, enter a value that resembles the
   following value in the **URL** field.

   ``/jump_to_id/<location ID>``

   Make sure to replace <location ID> (including the brackets) with the
   location ID that you copied in step 1, and make sure that you include both
   forward slashes (/).

  .. caution::
    Ensure you use ``/jump_to_id/<location ID>`` as the URL value. Do not
    use the URL of the unit that you see in the browser address bar.  If you do
    not use ``/jump_to_id/<location ID>``, the link will be broken if you
    export and then import the course.

#. If you want the link to open in a new window, select the dropdown arrow
   next to the **Open Link In...** field, and then select **New Window**. If
   not, you can leave the default value.

#. Select **Insert**.

#. Save the Text component and test the link.

.. _Add a Link to a File:

====================
Add a Link to a File
====================

.. tip::
 When you add links to files, open the Text component and the **Files &
 Uploads** page in separate browser windows. You can then more quickly copy
 file URLs.

You can add a link in a Text component to any file that is uploaded for the
course. For more information about uploading files, see :ref:`Add Files to a
Course`.

.. note::
 Do not use this method to add images to Text components. Instead, use the
 method in :ref:`Add an Image to a Text Component`.


#. On the **Files & Uploads** page, locate the file that you want, and then
   select **Studio** in the **Copy URLs** column.

  .. note::
   You must use the **Studio** URL to link to the file, not the **Web** URL.
   For more information, see :ref:`Add Files to a Course`.

#. In the Text component where you want to add the link, select the text that
   you want to make into the link.

#. In the toolbar, select the link icon.

#. In the **Insert link** dialog box, paste the Studio URL for the file in the
   **URL** field. For example, the URL might resemble the following URL.

   ``/static/FileName.pdf``

   Make sure that you include both forward slashes (/).

#. (optional) If you want the link to open in a new window, select the dropdown
   arrow next to the **Open Link In...** field, and then select **New Window**.
   If not, you can leave the default value.

#. Select **OK**.

#. Save the Text component and test the link.

.. _Add an Image to a Text Component:

*********************************
Add an Image to a Text Component
*********************************

When you use the Visual Editor, you can add any image from your computer to
a Text component. You can see a preview of the image before you add it to the
component.

.. note::
 * Before you add an image, make sure that you obtain copyright permissions for
   images you use in your course, and that you cite sources appropriately.
 * To add effective alternative text for images, review :ref:`Best Practices
   for Describing Images`.
 * You can only add one image at one time.
 * Each individual image file must be smaller than 10 MB.

To add an image to a Text component, you can use one of the following
procedures.

* :ref:`Locate an image <Locate an Image on Your Computer>` by using the
  **Browse Your Computer** option in the **Add Image** dialog box.
* :ref:`Select an image <Select a Previously Uploaded Image>` that you have
  previously uploaded.

.. _Locate an Image on Your Computer:

================================
Locate an Image on Your Computer
================================

#. In the Text component, position the cursor where you want to add an image,
   and then select the image icon on the toolbar.

#. In the **Add an Image** dialog box, **Upload a New Image (10 MB max)**.

#. In the dialog box that opens, locate the file that you want to add, and
   then select **Open**, or locate the image in the Image Gallery, and then
   select **Next**.

   As soon as your image is selected, the **Image Settings** dialog box
   opens.

#. In the **Edit Image Settings** dialog box, add an image description.

   * In the **Alt Text** field, enter alternative text for
     the image. This text becomes the value of the ``alt`` attribute in HTML
     and is required for your course to be fully accessible. For more
     information, see :ref:`Best Practices for Describing Images`.

   * If your image is a decorative image that does not convey important
     information, select the **This image is decorative (no alt text required)**
     checkbox.

#. (optional) Specify the width and height of your image. For more information,
   see :ref:`Change the Image Size`.

#. Select **Save**.

#. Save the Text component and test the image.

.. _Select a Previously Uploaded Image:

==================================
Select a Previously Uploaded Image
==================================

#. When you upload an image, the image automatically becomes available in a
   gallery list that opens when you add an image to a Text component.

#. In the Text component, position the cursor where you want to add an image,
   and then select the image icon on the toolbar.

#. In the **Add an Image** dialog box, locate the image in the gallery list,
   and then select **Next**.  There are sort and filter options available for
   the gallery list to make it easy to find the image you need.

#. In the **Image Settings** dialog box, complete one of the following
   options.

   * In the **Alt Text** field, enter alternative text for
     the image. This text becomes the value of the ``alt`` attribute in HTML
     and is required for your course to be fully accessible. For more
     information, see :ref:`Best Practices for Describing Images`.

   * If your image is a decorative image that does not convey important
     information, select the **This image is decorative (no alt text
     required)** checkbox.

#. (optional) Specify the width and height of your image. For more information,
   see :ref:`Change the Image Size`.

#. Select **Save**.

#. Save the Text component and test the image.

.. _Format an Image in a Text Component:

===================================
Format an Image in a Text Component
===================================

You have several options for formatting an image in a Text component.

 :depth: 1

.. _Align an Image:

Align an Image
**************

To align your image to the right, the left, or the center, follow these steps.

#. In the Text component, select the image.

#. On the toolbar, select the left align, right align, or center icon.

.. _Change the Image Size:

Change the Image Size
*********************

To change the size of your image, follow these steps.

#. In the Text component, select the image that you want to edit, and then
   select the Contextual image icon that appears above the image.

#. In the **Image Settings** dialog box, locate **Image Dimensions**, and
   then enter the values that you want for the **Width** and **Height**
   options.

   .. note::
    To make sure that the image keeps the same proportions when you change the
    image size, make sure that **Lock proportions** is selected, and enter a
    number in only the **Width** field or the **Height** field. After you tab
    or click outside that field, the number in the other field changes to a
    value that maintains the image proportions.

#. Select **Save**.

If you want to change the image back to the original size, clear the values in
the **Width** and **Height** fields.

.. _Power Paste:

***********
Power Paste
***********

Many course authoring teams rely on copying and pasting content from documents
such as Google docs or Microsoft Word. Correct formatting in Studio and the LMS
can be most easily realized through Power Paste.

When you copy and paste content into the Text Editor, you will receive a “Paste
Formatting Options” popup on the page.  If you choose “Remove formatting”, then
the bullets will be correctly aligned with text in both Studio and the LMS. If
you select “Keep formatting”, then the formatting is unchanged and bullets and
text will not be aligned in Studio or the LMS.


.. image:: ../images/HTML_PowerPastePop.png
  :alt: an image of the popup that you will receive after copying and
   pasting content into the Text Editor. This popup allows you to select
   either keep or remove formatting.
  :width: 300

Below is a bulleted list example, a type of formatting that commonly needs Power
Paste.  If you select “Keep formatting”, this is what Studio and LMS will show:

.. image:: ../images/PowerPaste_KeepFormatting.png
  :alt: an image of a bulleted list in LMS in which you have chosen to “keep
   formatting” when you were in the editor. The bullets and text are misaligned.

However, if you select “Remove formatting”, this is what Studio and LMS will show:

.. image:: ../images/PowerPaste_RemoveFormatting.png
  :alt: an image of a bulleted list in LMS in which you have chosen to “remove
   formatting” when you were in the editor. The bullets and text are correctly

.. JRistau (26 Sept 2022) - LaTeX editor support was removed with the rollout of
.. the new Course Authoring based Text Editor.  Coursegraph shows ~100 active
.. courses that have enabled the LaTeX advanced module, and we have had no
.. issues reported since rollout of the new text editor.  The LaTeX component
.. is listed as “Unsupported” in studio (TNL-9993).  For these reasons, edX PM
.. has decided to remove this section of our support documentation.


.. _import latex code:

.. ****************************************
.. Import LaTeX Code into a Text Component
.. ****************************************

.. You can import LaTeX code into a Text component. You might do this, for
.. example, if you want to create "beautiful math" such as the math in the
.. following image.

.. .. image:: ../images/HTML_LaTeX_LMS.png
 :alt: Math formulas created with LaTeX in a Text component.

.. .. warning::
 The LaTeX processor that Studio uses to convert LaTeX code to XML is a third
 party tool. We recommend that you use this feature with caution. If you use
 the tool, make sure that you work with your partner manager.

.. ==========================
.. Enable the LaTeX Processor
.. ==========================

.. The LaTeX processor is not enabled by default. To enable it, you have to change
.. the advanced settings in your course.

.. #. In Studio, select **Settings**, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

.. #. In the field for the **Enable LaTeX Compiler** policy key, change **false**
   to **true**.

.. #. At the bottom of the page, select **Save Changes**.

.. ==============================================
.. Add a Text Component that Contains LaTeX Code
.. ==============================================

.. When the LaTeX processor is enabled, you can create a Text component that
.. contains LaTeX code.

.. #. In the unit where you want to create the component, select **Text** under
   **Add New Component**, and then select **E-text Written in LaTeX**. The new
   component is added to the unit.

.. #. Select **Edit** to open the new component.

.. #. At the bottom of the component editor, select **Launch Latex Source
   Compiler**.

   The LaTeX editor opens.
