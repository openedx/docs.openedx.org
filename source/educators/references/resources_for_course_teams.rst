Documentation

Documentation for course teams is available from the docs.openedx.org web page.

* `Building and Running an Open edX Course`_ is a comprehensive guide with
  concepts and procedures to help you build a course in Studio and then
  use the Learning Management System (LMS) to run a course.

  You can access this guide by selecting **Help** in Studio or from the
  instructor dashboard in the LMS.

These guides open in your web browser. The left side of each page includes a
**Search docs** field and links to the contents of that guide. To open or save
a PDF version, select **v: latest** at the lower right of the page, then select
**PDF**.

.. note:: If you use the Safari browser, be aware that it does not support the
 search feature for the HTML versions of the Open edX guides. This is a known
 limitation.
