Introduction to Video
************************

Videos in a course supplement active learning components, such as discussions
and problems. Videos can be effective for presenting motivating material,
showing experiments, reducing cognitive load for complex content, and other
purposes.

When you create video content, you need to keep various guidelines in mind.
This section describes these guidelines, as well as video technical
specifications, how to add video content to your course, and how to specify
options for your videos.

For more information about how learners can interact with course videos, see
`Video Player`_.

.. important::

   It is very important that all of your videos are accessible to learners with
   disabilities. Be sure to review :ref:`Creating Accessible Media` before you
   create videos for your course.

You use video components to add videos to your course in Studio. In video
components, you add the name and location of your video, as well as the video
transcript. Learners view your videos in the LMS.

For information about the way learners interact with videos, see
`Video Player`_.

For more information about adding videos to your course, see :ref:`Add a Video`.

For more information about options in the video component, see :ref:`Additional
Video Options`.

To make a video visible in your course, you create a video component in a Unit
in Studio, and then you add information for the video to the video component.

.. _Set Up a Hosting Service:

*********************
Third Party Hosting
*********************

To upload a video to a third party hosting site, follow the instructions for
that site. Keep the following guidelines in mind.

 * If you host your videos on `YouTube`_, you must follow all rules and
   restrictions that are associated with YouTube.

* The URL for the video that you upload on a third party hosting site must end
  in .mp4, .mpeg, .webm, or .ogg. The video player cannot support videos that
  you upload on sites such as Vimeo, Dailymotion, or other sites that use their
  own player.

  To help make sure all standard browsers can play your video, edX strongly
  recommends that you use .mp4 format.

  The video URL might resemble the following example.

  ``https://s3.amazonaws.com/edx-course-videos/edx-edx101/EDXSPCPJSP13-G030300.mp4``

* If you have copies of a video in multiple resolutions, you must upload each
  copy to the hosting site. For more information, see :ref:`Video Guidelines`.

* After you upload a video on a hosting site, you must make sure you have the
  URL for that copy of the video. If you upload copies of your video on more
  than one hosting site, make sure you have the URL for each video location.
