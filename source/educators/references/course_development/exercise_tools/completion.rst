The completion tool provides learners with a way to mark sections of the
course as completed. It helps learners to track their progress through
sections of the course, including for ungraded activities such as reading
text, watching video, or participating in course discussions.

Overview
********

The completion tool provides learners with a way to indicate both to themselves
and to the course team that they have completed an activity.

The completion tool is itself a graded component and is therefore always
included on the learner **Progress** page. However, depending on whether it is
used in a graded or ungraded section of the course, it appears either as a
part of the learner's final grade or as a practice score, respectively.

If you use the completion tool in an ungraded section of the course, the score
for completing the activity that it is associated with is listed as a practice
score on the **Progress** page. Practice scores are not included in the
learner's final grade for the course.

You can also use the completion tool in graded sections of the course. If you
do so, a score for completing the activity is included in learners' final grades. For example, if you include a completion component in a particular unit
of the course content, learners who use the component to mark the unit as complete receive 1/1 points, while learners who do not mark the unit as
complete receive 0/1 points. These scores are included in learners' final
grades on the **Progress** page.

.. note:: EdX recommends using the completion tool primarily to track progress
   for ungraded activities such as reading assigned texts, watching videos,
   or participating in course discussions.


**********************
The Completion Control
**********************

When you add a completion component to a unit, learners see a control that is
labeled **Mark as complete**. In this example, the completion component follows
a Text component.

After a learner selects this control, the label changes to **Unmark**. Learners
who revisit their work in a unit and want to change the completion status can
select this control as many times as needed.
