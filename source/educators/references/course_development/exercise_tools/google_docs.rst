Before you make content from an external site available through your course, be
sure to review the content to ensure that it is accessible to people with
disabilities. For more information, see :ref:`Accessibility Best Practices for
Course Content Development`.

You can also use :ref:`Google calendars<Google Calendar Tool>` in the course
body. For more information, see :ref:`Google Calendar Tool`.

.. note:: Google services are not available in some regions and countries. If
  Google services are not available in a learner's area, the learner might see
  an "image unavailable" message in the place of the Google Drive file or
  calendar.  It is recommended that you provide alternative resources for learners in these areas.

Overview

You can embed a Google Drive file in your course so that learners see the file
in the course body. For example, you can share a Google spreadsheet with
learners.

You can embed the following types of Google Drive files.

* Google Docs (text documents)
* Google Drawings (images)
* Google Forms (forms or surveys)
* Google Slides (presentations)
* Google Sheets (spreadsheets)

Editing Google Drive Files

When you edit and save a Google Drive file that is embedded in your course,
learners see the updates immediately. You make changes to files with the
Google user interface. You do not need to edit the Google Document component.
