The text input problem type is a simple problem type that can be added to any
course. At a minimum, text input problems include a question or prompt and a
response field for free form answer text. By adding hints, feedback, or both,
you can give learners guidance and help when they work on a problem.

**********
Overview
**********

In text input problems, learners enter text into a response field. The
response can include numbers, letters, and special characters such as
punctuation marks. Because the text that the learner enters must match the
instructor's specified answer exactly, including spelling and punctuation, it is
recommend that you specify more than one correct answer for text input
problems to allow for differences in capitalization and typographical errors.
