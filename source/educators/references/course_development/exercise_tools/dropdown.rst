The dropdown problem type is a simple problem type that can be added to any
course. Dropdown problems include a question or prompt and
several answer options with a single correct answer. By adding hints, feedback, or both, you can give
learners guidance and help when they work on a problem.

********
Overview
********

In dropdown problems, learners select one answer from a list of answer options.
Unlike :ref:`single select<Single Select>` problems, where the answer
choices are always visible directly below the question, the answer options for
dropdown problems do not appear until the learner selects the dropdown arrow.

Dropdown problems can only have one correct answer per question, we recommend
adding a "Both B & C" answer where multiple selections could be correct.
