Accessing Metrics for ORA Assignments
######################################

.. tags:: educator, reference

After you release an Open Response Assessment (ORA) assignment, you can access various
metrics for the assignment or for all open response assessment assignments in
the course. For example, you can view the number of learners in each step of the
assignment or in possible states such as "Waiting" or "Completed" within the
assignment. In addition to viewing metrics for the assignment or for assignments
in a course, you can also access assignment details for an individual learner,
or :ref:`generate a report <Generate ORA Report>` containing learner and
response details for ORA assignments in the course.

For information about tasks that you can perform on learner responses in an
ORA assignment, including :ref:`performing a grade override
assessment<Override a learner assessment grade>` or :ref:`cancelling a
learner's submission<Remove a learner response from peer grading>`, see
:ref:`Managing ORA Assignments`.
