Core Problem Types
##################

.. tags:: educator, reference

The problem types that you can include in any course, without taking any
other steps to identify or enable additional exercises or tools, are the core
problem types. When you add a problem component in Studio, the core problem
types are classified as either **Simple Problem Types** or **Advanced**.

Simple Problem Types
*********************

When you create a problem in Studio, the editor opens with options for the
following problem types. When you select any of the simple problem types, the
:ref:`simple editor<Simple Editor>` opens.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 60 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Problem Type
     - Description
     - Support
   * - :ref:`Single Select`
     - In single select problems, learners select one answer from a set of
       possible answers, which are visible directly below the question.
     - Full support; mobile-ready
   * - :ref:`Multi select`
     - In multi-select problems, learners select one or more options from a list of
       possible answers. To answer the problem correctly, a learner must select
       all of the options that are correct answers, and none of the options
       that are incorrect.
     - Full support; mobile-ready
   * - :ref:`Dropdown`
     - In dropdown problems, learners choose one answer from a set of possible
       answers, which are presented in a dropdown list after the learner
       selects the dropdown arrow.
     - Full support; mobile-ready
   * - :ref:`Numerical Input`
     - In numerical input problems, learners enter numbers or specific and
       relatively simple mathematical expressions to answer a question. These
       problems allow only integers and a few select constants. You can specify
       a margin of error, and you can specify a correct answer either
       explicitly or by using a Python script.
     - Full support; mobile-ready
   * - :ref:`Text Input`
     - In text input problems, learners enter text into a response field. The
       response can include numbers, letters, and special characters such as
       punctuation marks.
     - Full support; mobile-ready

By adding hints, feedback, or both, you can give learners guidance and help
when they work on a problem. When you choose one of the simple problem types,
the editor interface provides additional guidance and text fields for entering
these options. All of these problem types also have full support and are
mobile-ready.


Advanced Problem Types
***********************

If none of the simple problem types fit what you need, the editor's problem type
select page has an option for **Advanced problem types**. Selecting this option
will bring you to a list of advanced problems. When you select any of the
advanced problem types, the :ref:`advanced editor<Advanced Editor>` opens.

* If you choose the **Blank Advanced Problem** option, the editor opens without
  providing a template or example for you to follow. You can begin to add OLX
  markup and the text for required and optional problem elements immediately.

* If you choose one of the following problem types, a template appears in the
  editor with guidance for adding all of that problem type's required elements,
  as well as several optional elements.

.. note:: Some advanced problem types are :ref:`unsupported<Levels of
   Support>` and are not available in the list of problem types unless you
   enable a setting in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Unsupported
   Advanced Problem Types` and :ref:`Add Unsupported Exercises Problems`.


.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 60 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Type
     - Description
     - Support

   * - :ref:`Custom JavaScript Display and Grading<Custom JavaScript>`
     - Custom JavaScript display and grading problems (also called custom
       JavaScript problems or JS input problems) allow you to create a custom
       problem or tool that uses JavaScript and then add the problem or tool
       directly into Studio.
     - Full support
   * - :ref:`Custom Python-evaluated Input (Write Your Own Grader)<Write Your Own Grader>`
     - In custom Python-evaluated input (also called "write-your-own-grader")
       problems, the grader uses a Python script that you create and embed in
       the problem to evaluate a learner's response or provide hints. These
       problems can be any type.
     - Provisional support
   * - :ref:`Math Expression Input`
     - Learners enter mathematical expressions to answer a question. These
       problems can include unknown variables and more complex symbolic
       expressions. You can specify a correct answer either explicitly or by
       using a Python script.
     - Full support; mobile-ready

.. _Unsupported Advanced Problem Types:


Unsupported Advanced Problem Types
===================================

The following advanced problem types are :ref:`not supported<Levels of
Support>` by the Open edX Platform. You can enable an option to make unsupported problem types
available in Studio. For more information, see
:ref:`Add_Unsupported_Exercises_Problems`.

   :widths: 25 60 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Type
     - Description
     - Support
   * - :ref:`Circuit Schematic Builder`
     - Learners arrange circuit elements such as voltage sources, capacitors,
       resistors, and MOSFETs on an interactive grid. They then submit a DC,
       AC, or transient analysis of their circuits to the system for grading.
     - Not supported
   * - :ref:`Image Mapped Input`
     - Learners answer prompts by selecting a defined area in an image. You
       define the area by including coordinates in the body of the problem.
     - Not supported
   * - :ref:`Problem with Adaptive Hint`
     - A problem with an adaptive hint evaluates a learner's response, then
       gives the learner feedback or a hint based on that response so that the
       learner is more likely to answer correctly on the next attempt. These
       problems can be text input or single select problems.
     - Not supported
