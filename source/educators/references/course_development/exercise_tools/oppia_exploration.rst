Overview
*********

You use the Oppia exploration tool in Studio to add interactive tutoring
activities, created as Oppia explorations, to your course. Oppia explorations
simulate conversations with human tutors to encourage exploration and
experiential learning.

.. note:: Oppia explorations are not assessments that can be graded. At this
 time, you should not add Oppia exploration components to the graded
 subsections of your course.

The following example shows an Oppia exploration as learners see it in the edX
LMS.
