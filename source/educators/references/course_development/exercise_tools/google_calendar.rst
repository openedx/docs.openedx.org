Before you make content from an external site available through your course, be
sure to review the content to ensure that it is accessible to people with
disabilities. For more information, see :ref:`Accessibility Best Practices for
Course Content Development`.

You can also add Google Drive files, such as documents, spreadsheets, and
images, to your course. For more information, see :ref:`Google Drive Files
Tool`.

.. note:: Google services are not available in some regions and countries.
  If Google services are not available in a learner's area, the learner might
  see an "image unavailable" message in the place of the Google Drive file or
  Google Calendar. The recommendation is to provide alternative resources
  for learners in these areas.

Overview
*********

You can embed a Google Calendar in your course so that learners see the
calendar in the course body. You can use a Google Calendar to share quiz dates,
office hours, or other schedules of interest to learners.

Editing Google Calendars
**************************

When you make changes to a Google Calendar that is embedded in your course,
learners see the updates immediately. You make changes to calendars with the
Google user interface. You do not need to edit the Google Calendar component.
