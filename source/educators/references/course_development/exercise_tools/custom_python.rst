.. tags:: educator, reference

In custom Python-evaluated input (also called "write-your-own-grader"
problems), the grader uses a Python script that you create and embed in the
problem to evaluate a learner's response or provide hints. These problems can
be any type. :ref:`Numerical input<Numerical Input>` and :ref:`text input<Text
Input>` problems are the most common write-your-own-grader problems.

Custom Python-evaluated input problems can include the following advanced
problem types.

* :ref:`Chemical Equation`
* :ref:`Custom JavaScript`
* :ref:`Gene Explorer`
* :ref:`Protein Builder`
