Course About Video Guidelines
##############################

.. tags:: educator, reference

The course About video should excite and entice potential learners to enroll,
and reveal some of the personality that the course team brings to the course.

This video should answer these key questions.

* Who is teaching the course?
* What university or institution is the course affiliated with?
* What topics and concepts are covered in your course?
* Why should a learner enroll in your course?

This video should deliver your message as concisely as possible and have a run
time of less than two minutes.

Before you upload a course About video, make sure that it follows the
same :ref:`video guidelines <Video Compression Specifications>`
as your course content videos.

.. note::

  * If you upload both a course image and a course About video, the course
    image appears on learner dashboards with a **play** icon superimposed on
    it. If you upload only a course video, the first frame of the video
    file appears with the **play** icon.

  * The process for adding a course about video is different than the process
    for including videos as part of the content of your course. For more
    information about including video content, see :ref:`Introduction to Video`.
