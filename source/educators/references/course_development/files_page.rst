File Size

The maximum size for each file is 10 MB. We recommend that you use standard
compression tools to reduce PDF and image file sizes before you add the files
to your course.

You can upload multiple files at a time.

If you have very large audio files or large data sets to share with your
students, do not use the **Files** page to add these files to your course.
Instead, use another hosting service to host these files.


.. _Find Files:

The **Files** page lists up to 50 files at one time.  If your course has more
than 50 files, additional files are listed on other pages.

To find a file on the **Files** page, you can use the **Search** option, or
you can view the page that lists the file.

* To use the **Search** option, enter one of the following search terms in the
  **Search** field.

  * The full file name.
  * The file name extension, or file type.
  * Part of the file name. You can also enter multiple parts of a file name.

  For example, if the file is named **FirstCourseImage.jpg**, you can enter any
  of the following search terms in the **Search** field.

  * ``FirstCourseImage.jpg``
  * ``.jpg``
  * ``First`` ``Image``

You can also sort files by Name (A-Z), Name (Z-A), Newest, Oldest, File size
