To develop subsections in your course, you must first understand the
following topics.

****************************
What Is a Subsection?
****************************

Sections are divided into subsections, which in turn contain one or more units.
A subsection may represent a topic in your course, or another organizing
principle. Subsections are sometimes called "lessons" or they might represent a
week's worth of material.

***********************************
Viewing Subsections in the Outline
***********************************

For more information see :ref:`Course Outline`

************************************************
Subsections and Visibility to Learners
************************************************

Learners cannot see any content in a subsection until you schedule a release
date, and that release date has passed.

If a subsection's release date has passed, learners can see content in the
subsection if the following conditions are met.

* The release date of the parent section has passed.
* The units have been published.
* The subsection or the units are not hidden from learners.

To control whether learners have access to the subsection and its units after
a subsection's release date, you can apply various visibility settings.

By default, the subsection and its units are available to learners, except for
any units that you have explicitly hidden from learners.

You can also choose to entirely hide a subsection so that the subsection and
its units are not visible to learners at all in the course navigation, or you
can hide the contents of a subsection after the subsection due date has passed.
For more information about subsection visibility settings, see :ref:`Hide a
Subsection from Students`.


.. note::
   Release dates and times that you set are in Coordinated Universal Time
   (UTC). You might want to verify that you have specified the time that you
   intend by using a time zone converter such as `Time and Date Time Zone Converter <http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html>`_.

   Learners who have specified a time zone in their account settings see course
   dates and times converted to their specified time zone. Learners who have
   not specified a time zone in their account settings see course dates and
   times on their dashboards, in the body of the course, and on their
   **Progress** pages in the time zone that their browsers specify. Learners
   see other course dates and times in UTC.


************************************************
Release Statuses of Subsections
************************************************

As a course author, you control the release status of subsections. For the
content of a subsection to be visible to learners, the subsection must be
released. See the following topics for more information about the possible
release statuses of subsections.

==========================
Scheduled with the Section
==========================

When you create a subsection, it is set by default to release on the same date
and time as the section it is in. Therefore, published content in the
subsection is visible to learners at the date and time the section is released.

When a subsection is in the "Scheduled with Section" state, and the section is
scheduled, the subsection is visible in the outline with a vertical green bar
next to the subsection's display name.

You can change the release date for a subsection to be different from the
section it is in. For more information, see :ref:`Set a Subsection Release
Date`.

========================
Unscheduled
========================

If the parent section is unscheduled, when you create a new subsection it
will also be unscheduled.

Regardless of the publishing status of units within the subsection, no content
in an unscheduled subsection is visible to learners.

When a subsection is unscheduled, the subsection is visible in the outline with
a vertical gray bar next to the subsection's display name.

Content in the subsection is not visible to learners until you set a release
date and the date passes.

===================================
Scheduled Later than the Section
===================================

You can set a subsection to release on a date after the section releases.

Content in a subsection that is scheduled for release on a future date is not
visible to learners, even if some or all of the units in the subsection are
published.

When a subsection is scheduled, even if the subsection is scheduled to release
later than the section, the subsection is visible in the outline with a
vertical green bar next to the subsection's display name.

The scheduled date must pass for the subsection to be visible to learners.

==================================
Scheduled with Unpublished Changes
==================================

You can make changes to a published unit before its parent subsection
is released.

In this situation, when the release date for the subsection passes, the last
published version of units within the subsection are made visible to learners.
The changes in units are not visible to learners until you publish them.

When a subsection is scheduled but has unpublished changes, the subsection is
visible in the outline with a vertical yellow bar next to the subsection's
display name. When you expand the subsection, the unit that has unpublished
changes is visible.

==================================
Released with Unpublished Changes
==================================

If you modify a unit within a released subsection, those modifications are not
visible to students until you publish them.

When a subsection is scheduled but has unpublished changes, the subsection is
visible in the outline with a vertical yellow bar next to the subsection's
display name. When you expand the subsection, the unit that has unpublished
changes is visible.

===========================
Released
===========================

A subsection that is released is visible to learners; however, learners see
only units within the subsection that are published.

When a subsection is released, the subsection is visible in the outline
with a vertical blue bar next to the subsection's display name.

===========================
Staff Only Content
===========================

A subsection can contain a unit that is hidden from learners and available to
members of the course team only. That unit is not visible to learners, even if
the subsection has been released.

When a subsection contains a unit that has staff-only content, the subsection
is visible in the outline with a vertical black bar next to the subsection's
display name.
