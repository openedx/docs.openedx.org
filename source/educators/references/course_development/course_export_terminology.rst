Course Outline Terminology in Exported Files

Sections, subsections, units, and components have different names in the Studio
**Course Outline** view and in the list of files that you see after you
export your course and open the ``.xml`` files for editing. The following table
lists the names of these elements in the **Course Outline** view and in a list
of files.
