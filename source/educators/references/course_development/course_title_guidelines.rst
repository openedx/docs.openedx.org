Course Title Guidelines
#########################

.. tags:: educator, reference

The course title (sometimes also called the course name) and number are
important identifiers for your course. It is a good idea to use titles and
numbers that are easy to understand and remember.

When you determine the title of your course, consider the following guidelines.

* Use title capitalization and normal spacing and punctuation.
* Limit the course name to 70 characters. Many of the most effective
  course titles have 50 or fewer characters.
* If the course is part of a sequence, create a title that includes both
  sequence and course information, formatted as "Sequence: Course".
* Select a course title that clearly indicates the course subject matter.
* Make sure the course title follows search engine optimization (SEO)
  guidelines.
* Make sure the course title targets a global audience.

For information about how to add your course name, see
:ref:`Creating a New Course <Create a New Course>`.

.. note::
  The title that you specify when you create your course becomes part of the
  course URL. The course URL cannot be changed. However, if you want to change
  the way that your course title appears in Studio and the LMS, see
  :ref:`Change the Course Title <Change the Course Title>`.
