Course Number Guidelines

.. tags:: educator, reference

The course title (sometimes also called the course name) and number are
important identifiers for your course. It is a good idea to use titles and
numbers that are easy to understand and remember.

Course numbers have the following guidelines.

* Course numbers can have a maximum of 10 characters.
* Characters can be letters, numbers or periods.
* If a course consists of several modules, the course number can have an ending
  such as .1x or .2x.

.. note::
  The number that you specify when you create your course becomes part of the
  course URL. The course URL cannot be changed. However, if you want to change
  the way that your course number appears in Studio and the LMS, see
  :ref:`Change the Course Number <Change the Course Number>`.
