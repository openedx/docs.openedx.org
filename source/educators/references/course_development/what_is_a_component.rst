A component is the part of a unit that contains your actual course content. A
unit can contain one or more components.

By default, Studio includes four basic types of components for you to add to
your course.

* **Discussion** components provide discussion spaces in the body of your
  course. Learners can explore ideas about a lesson with their peers in a
  discussion space.
* **Text** components allow you to add text, images, and some types of learning
  tools to your course. Content in Text components is formatted as HTML.
* **Problem** components enable you to add many different types of exercises
  and problems to your course, from simple single select problems to complex
  circuit schematic exercises.
* **Video** components contain the videos that you want to include in your
  course.
