Another way to create a course in Studio is to re-run an existing course. When
you re-run a course, most, but not all, of the original course content is
duplicated to the new course. The original course is not changed in any way.

After you create a re-run course, modifications to the original course and the
re-run course are independent. Changes to either course have no effect on the
other course. Therefore, you should ensure that the original course content is
as complete as possible before you re-run the course.
