Adding Tooltips to a Problem

.. tags:: educator, reference

You can add inline tooltips to help learners understand terminology or other aspects of a problem. Tooltips display text to learners when they move their
cursors over a tooltip icon.

The following example problem includes two tooltips. The tooltip that provides
a definition for "ROI" is being shown.

.. note::
  For learners using a screen reader, the tooltip expands to make its
  associated text accessible when the screen reader focuses on the tooltip
  icon.

To add the tooltip, you wrap the text that you want to appear as the tooltip in
the ``clarification`` element.  For example, the following problem contains two
tooltips.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
      <text>
          <p>Given the data in Table 7 <clarification>Table 7: "Example PV
            Installation Costs", Page 171 of Roberts textbook</clarification>,
            compute the ROI <clarification><strong>ROI</strong>: Return on
            Investment</clarification> over 20 years.
          </p>
       . . .
