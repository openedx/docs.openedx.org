You can specify licensing options for your course content as well as for each
video in your course. By specifying the license, you communicate to learners
whether and how they can reuse your course content.

You specify licensing options in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Set
Course Content Licensing`.

.. note::

  In order for Course Licenses to be viewable in Studio, the ``FEATURES[‘LICENSING’]`` flag must
  be set to True (it defaults to False). Ask your site administration team to set this
  flag for you if you wish to use this feature.

of the following license options.

* Creative Commons

.. _All Rights Reserved License:

========================================
All Rights Reserved License

All Rights Reserved indicates to learners that you own the copyright but
reserve all rights for sharing copies of course content or videos. Learners
cannot reuse or republish course content or videos that have All Rights
Reserved licenses.

.. _Creative Commons License:

The Creative Commons license indicates to learners that you own the copyright
but are granting certain permissions for reuse, depending on the license

     - This option allows others to copy, distribute, display, and perform your
       copyrighted work but only if they give credit to you in the way that you

       course content. You cannot clear this option.

     - This option allows others to distribute, display, and perform your work
       -- and derivative works based upon it -- but for non-commercial purposes
       only.
   * - **No Derivatives**
     - This option allows others to distribute, display, and perform only
       verbatim copies of your work, not derivative works based upon it. You
       cannot use this option with the **Share Alike** option.
   * - **Share Alike**
     - This option allows others to distribute derivative works only under a
       license identical to the license that governs your work. You cannot use
       this option with the **No Derivatives** option.

the license at the bottom right of the video player.

For the course and for videos, if you choose **All Rights Reserved**, learners
see **All Rights Reserved**; if you choose **Creative Commons** and select any
allowed combination of options, learners see **Some Rights Reserved** and can
select the link to see details.
