.. _Add a Content Experiment in Studio:

You can add a content experiment in a unit or container page. In Studio, you
create and view content for all groups in the content experiment in a
container page for the experiment, as shown in :ref:`Create Content for
Content Experiment Groups`.

When a learner views a unit with the content experiment, they has no indication
there is a content experiment in the unit, and the content experiment display
name is not shown. She sees only the content that you configure for the group
she is assigned to. To the learner, the unit with the content experiment is no
different than any other unit.

To configure a content experiment in Studio, visit :ref:`Configure Your Course for Content Experiments`.

After you configure a content experiment, you can change its group
configuration. For more information, see :ref:`Change Group Configuration for
a Content Experiment`.

You can move a content experiment from its current location to a different
location in the course outline. For information, see :ref:`Reorganizing
Components`.
