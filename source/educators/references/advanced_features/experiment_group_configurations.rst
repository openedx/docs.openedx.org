=======================================
Experiment Group Configurations
=======================================

The edX Platform assigns learners to each experiment group in a group
configuration.

Experiment group assignments have the following characteristics.

* Dynamic

  The edX Platform assigns a learner to an experiment group the first time he
  or she views a content experiment that uses the group configuration.

* Random

  You cannot control which learners are assigned to which experiment group.

* Evenly distributed

  The edX Platform keeps track of the size of experiment groups, and assigns
  new learners to groups evenly. For example, if you have two experiment groups
  in a configuration, each group includes 50% of the learners in the course; if
  you have four experiment groups, each group includes 25% of the learners.

* Permanent

  Learners remain in their assigned experiment groups regardless of how many
  content experiments you set up that use the same group configuration.
