.. _Course Highlight Message:

================================
Course Highlight Email
================================

An Open edX intance might sends Course Highlight messages for both Instructor-paced and Self-paced
courses. The logic for when the message is sent depends on the Course pacing.

* Instructor-paced:

  * Highlights are sent every seven days after a learner enrolls in a course.

* Self-paced:

  * Highlights are sent based on the due dates calculated from the learner's enrollment date, the number of sections in the course, and the expected duration of the course (known as a Personalized Learner Schedule). Once the calculated due date for a section has passed, the highlights for the next section are sent out.
  * Example: Section 2 ends on December 3, 2020 for a specific learner based on their Schedule. Section 3 highlights will be sent out on December 4, 2020 for that learner.
  * **Note**: This could result in highlights being sent out every few days (3/4 days) in shorter expected duration courses with many sections or longer than a week (10+ days) in longer expected duration courses with few sections.

For more information, see :ref:`Set Section Highlights for Course Highlight
Messages`.

.. _Discussion Notification:

=======================
Discussion Notification
=======================

After a learner or course team member creates a post in the course discussions, the Open edX intance might sends the following email message the first time a learner or course team member replies to the original post.

::

  Subject: Response to <title of post>

  <username> replied to <title of post>:

  <text of comment>

The message also contains a View discussion option that takes the learner to the discussion post. An Open edX intance does not send individual messages for any additional replies on the post.
