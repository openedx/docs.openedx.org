.. _Guidelines for Start and End Dates:

**********************************
Guidelines for Start and End Dates
**********************************

The start and end dates you set for your course are important for prospective
and current learners. Current learners see your course start or end date on
their dashboards. You should consider your course dates carefully.

**************************
Course Start Date and Time
**************************

The course start date and time specify when learners can access published
course content. By default, the course start date and time are set to
**01/01/2030** at **00:00 UTC** to ensure that your course does not start
before you intend it to.

The following guidelines can help you determine a course start date.

* Start on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
* Avoid major public holidays.
* Specify a month, day, and year. If you are unsure of the exact date, specify
  a day that is close to the estimated start date. For example, if your course
  will start near the end of March, specify March 31.
* Set the start time of your course early in the day, generally 00:00
  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or earlier. Learners often expect the course
  to be available on the start date in their own time zones and try to access
  course content during the day. If you do not specify a start time for your
  course, the course starts at 00:00 UTC.

Although learners cannot access any part of your course before the course
start date, course team members who are enrolled in the course and who have
the staff, admin, or beta tester role can see published content in the course
before the course start date. For information about testing your course
content before the course start date, see :ref:`Beta_Testing`.

.. note::
  You can set a different advertised start date for your course. You might do
  this if the exact start date is uncertain. For example, you could advertise
  the start date as "Coming Soon". For more information, see
  :ref:`Advertise a Different Start Date <Advertise a Different Start Date>`.

************************
Course End Date and Time
************************

The course end date and time specify when learners can no longer earn credit
toward certificates. Learners can continue to complete available coursework,
but cannot earn credit after the course ends. Learners who have earned
certificates can view the certificates soon after the course end date.

In self-paced courses, course teams can make certain course components
unavailable based on the course end date. For example, course teams can make a
final exam unavailable after the end date for a self-paced course. For more
details, see :ref:`Hide a Subsection After its Due Date <Hide a Subsection After its Due Date>`.

.. important::
  If you do not set a course end date, learners cannot access earned
  certificates.

******************************
Enrollment Start Date and Time
******************************

As soon as enrollment starts, prospective learners can see your course in the
course catalog, view the course **About** page, and enroll in the course.

The enrollment start date and time specify when learners can start to enroll
in the course. Ensure that the enrollment start date is early enough to allow
learners to both enroll in and prepare for the course.

.. _Enrollment End Date and Time:

****************************
Enrollment End Date and Time
****************************

The enrollment end date and time specify when learners can no longer enroll
in the course. Ensure that the enrollment end date is late enough to allow
learners adequate time to enroll. The enrollment end date cannot be later
than the course end date.


.. _View Start and End Dates:

************************************************
The Learner's View of Course Start and End Dates
************************************************

When learners browse courses, the start date for each course is visible in the
course catalog and in the course's About page.

To find the URL of your course's **About** page in Studio, select
**Settings**, and then select **Schedule & Details**.

After learners enroll in courses, the courses appear on their course
dashboards. To access the dashboard, learners select their usernames and then
select **Dashboard**. For a course that is in progress or has not yet started,
the start date is visible. For a course that has ended, the course end date is
visible.
