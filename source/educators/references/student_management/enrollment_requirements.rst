Learners can enroll themselves in a course during its defined enrollment
period.

The course creator and course team members with the Staff and Admin roles can
enroll learners in a course. These course team members can also unenroll
learners.

Data about course enrollment is available in the LMS, by selecting
**Instructor** to access the instructor dashboard. For more
information, see :ref:`View Learners Not Yet Enrolled`.

***************************
Registration and Enrollment
***************************

Before a learner can enroll in a course, he or she must complete these steps.

#. Register a user account, which includes supplying a valid email address, or your implementation of the Open edX
   platform. Each platform requires a separate user account.

#. Activate the registered account by following the emailed instructions.

As long as the course enrollment end date has not passed, learners who
have registered and activated user accounts can enroll themselves in
courses on your Open edX instance, or can enroll in other courses on your instance if they know the URL.

Course creators, Admins, and Staff, however, can enroll learners in a course
either before or after the learners register their user accounts.

.. important:: Course team members are not automatically enrolled in courses,
   although they can access content in Studio, and the LMS. To work
   on a course, every course team member must register, activate a user
   account, and enroll in the course.
