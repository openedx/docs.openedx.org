Overview of Group Configurations
****************************************

Before you can create :ref:`content experiments<Overview of Content
Experiments>`, you must specify at least one group configuration for your
course.

A group configuration defines how many groups of learners are in an experiment.
You can have any number of group configurations in your course. When you create
a content experiment, you select the group configuration to use.

For example, you might want to run two different content experiments at
different times during your course. In one content experiment, learners either
see a video or complete a reading assignment. You can then include problems so
that you can see which group learned the material more completely. For this
content experiment, you need a group configuration that assigns your learners
to two experiment groups.

In the other content experiment, you can present the same question using four
different types of problems. For this content experiment, you need a
group configuration that assigns your learners to four experiment groups.
