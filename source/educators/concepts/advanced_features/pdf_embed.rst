The PDF embed tool allows you to add PDF documents to your course. It uses an
the browser's built-in PDF viewing capability, and provides options for
downloading the document or its original source.

PDFs are not considered accessible. They are finalized documents intended for
printing exactly specified copies. This makes them difficult for screen readers
and other assistance technology to interpret. You are strongly encouraged to
use alternative means of presenting the information in these documents, such as
a :ref:`text component<Working with Text Components>`. Please visit the
:ref:`Accessibility Best Practices Checklist` for more information.

Additionally, viewing PDFs on mobile devices results in a poor learner
experience.

Nevertheless, the PDF embed block exists to handle the case of a document
being unavailable in other formats, or for when variations in representing the
document are unacceptable.
