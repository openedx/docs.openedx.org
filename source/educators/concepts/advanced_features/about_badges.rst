The Badges feature allows learners to earn achievements (badges) for their learning activities.

Badges provide employers and peers concrete evidence of what learners have
accomplished in order to earn their credential and what they are now capable of.
Digital badges are a great way to motivate learning and display a learner's
subsequent achievements.

Badges are typically finer-grained than a traditional course certificate. They
are meant to introduce game mechanics to have more frequent sources of
motivation athan one would get from a cumulative certificate.

Currently, the Open edX Credentials service is highly integrated with the `Credly (by
Pearson)`_ and `Accredible`_ services.
