The Badges feature allows learners to earn achievements (badges) for their learning activities.

Badges provide employers and peers concrete evidence of what you had to do to
earn your credential and what you're now capable of. Digital badges are a
great way to motivate learning, and display a learner's subsequent achievements.
Although digital certificates may display more comprehensive details of an
achievement, some organizations prefer this type of digital credential due to
its increased 'shareability', with badges having the ability to be embedded
easily in more places, such as on social media profiles and email signatures.

Currently, the Open edX Badges service is highly integrated with the `Credly (by
Pearson)`_ and `Accredible`_ services.
