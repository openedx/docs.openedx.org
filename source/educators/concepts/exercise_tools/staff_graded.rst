.. _StaffGraded Grading:

Grading Learners
#################

.. tags:: educator, concept

While your course is running, after learners have had a chance to complete the off-platform assignment you’re grading, you can assign learner grades from the LMS Instructor view of the component as follows:

#. **Export scores.** Download a grading CSV and use this as a template to assign scores for this problem. You can use track/cohort filters to limit to grading only a subset of learners.

#. **(On your own machine) Fill out grades.** Open the CSV in a spreadsheet editor and assign scores to learners via “New Points” field. Leave scores that you don’t want to change blank.

#. **Import scores** Uploading the filled out CSV. Learners will immediately see their grades after import completes. Supports smaller courses - i.e. file sizes up to 4MB. *Note: [Provisionally supported: usage in large courses] To use in larger courses, break up your grade file CSV by rows, and import in separate files -- or use the track & cohort filters to limit to a subset of rows. In this case, keep the header row for each file. This manual approach for larger courses is error prone, so we are making it available as a use-at-your-own-risk feature for advanced users, but don’t explicitly support it.*

#. **Review result** File is uploaded, validated, scores are overwritten for non-blank rows. You’ll get a readout at the bottom of the screen.
