To prepare learners for a proctored exam, follow these guidelines:

* Emphasize that learners must be aware of the requirements before taking the
  exam, and that some of the requirements might take some preparation.
* Well before the exam, provide learners with information about the grading
  policy in your course.
* Explain what proctored exams are, and provide learners with links to the
  :ref:`OE SFD Proctored Exams` topic in the *Open edX
  Learner’s Guide*.
* Communicate the rules for proctored exams, including the :ref:`Online Proctoring Rules` in the *Open edX Learner’s
  Guide* as well as any specific rules for a particular exam. For information
  about creating specific rules, see
  :ref:`specifying_exam_rules_and_exceptions`.

*****************************************
The Learner Experience of Proctored Exams
*****************************************

The learner experience of a proctored exam depends on the proctoring service
that your course or organization uses. Typically, learners can expect to
download and install proctoring software, verify their identities, and use
their webcams to scan the testing environment before they take the exam. For
more information, see :ref:`OE SFD Proctored Exams` in the *Open
edX Learner's Guide*.

.. _Practice Proctored Exams:

************************
Practice Proctored Exams
************************

You can create an ungraded practice proctored exam for your course so that
learners can become familiar with the process of installing proctoring
software and performing the required checks ahead of time. Depending on the
proctoring service, learners might complete the following steps for a
practice proctored exam.

* Install the proctoring software.
* Complete identity checks.
* Complete a room scan.
* Complete any example problems in the exam.

.. note::
  Learners who complete practice exams must usually complete the same
  software installation and environment scan steps again when they take an
  actual proctored exam.
