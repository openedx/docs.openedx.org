Beta Testing a Course
#############################

.. tags:: educator, concept

To gather information about the overall experience of taking a course, you can
recruit beta testers to test your course before it is available to general learners.

During a beta test, you gather information about the experience of taking your
course in an effort to improve its quality. The phases of the beta testing
process, and some questions that you may find useful to consider as you prepare
for each phase, follow.

#. **Planning**: What are your objectives for the test? What is the schedule
   for testing?

#. **Recruitment**: How many testers do you need? How much time do you expect
   testers to spend? When do you need them to complete their feedback?

#. **Provide access to your course**: Can testers access your entire course
   immediately, or are its sections and subsections available at different
   times? How will that affect the schedule?

#. **Collect feedback**: How do you want testers to provide feedback? Who
   checks for feedback, and how often?

#. **Evaluate feedback**: How is feedback evaluated? Who decides what changes
   to make as a result, and on what schedule?

#. **Conclusion**: How do you acknowledge the efforts of your testers? What do
   you share with them about the results of their efforts?

There is no one answer to any of these questions. They are included here as
background on the role that beta testing can play in the preparation of your
course.

.. _Qualities_Testers:

***************************************
The Beta Testing Role
***************************************

Beta testers have early access to the course. Beta testers are not members of
the course team: they do not have information about "how it is supposed
to work". They use their own computers and Internet connections to view
videos, follow links, and complete problems. They interact with the course as
learners will to find, and make, mistakes.

However, beta testers are not the same as other learners in the course,
either. They have privileged access to the course and have more time to review
and complete the course materials than the enrolled learners do. Course
discussions are not open before the course start date, so beta testers cannot
participate in community conversations. As a result of these differences, beta
testers do not receive certificates when they complete a course.

.. note:: If one of your beta testers wishes to earn a certificate for the
 course, she must create a separate user account with a different username and
 email address. She can then use that separate, non-privileged user account to
 enroll in the course and repeat the work, completing assignments and exams
 when they are available to all learners.

==================================
Qualities of Good Beta Testers
==================================

A beta test is valuable in part because it is unscripted. Your beta testers are
not following a predetermined series of steps, or using a particular computer
environment, when they access your course. When you recruit beta testers,
however, you may find these skills and characteristics to be helpful.

* Curiosity.

* Attention to detail for identifying problems and inconsistencies.

* Solid communication skills for reporting problems to the course team.

Your beta testers should also have varying levels of knowledge about the course
content:

* To recognize when material is wrong or missing, at least one tester should
  know the content well.

* To identify material that is unclear, at least one tester should be less
  familiar with the content.

Depending on the objectives you set for your beta test, you might want to
consider recruiting testers who use assistive technologies, who have different
native languages, or who have varying levels of familiarity with computer
software.

=========================================
Using Course Team Members as Beta Testers
=========================================

The course team can provide valuable feedback about your course. However, they
are typically stakeholders in the success of your course and have a significant
amount of knowledge about it. As a result, they can be too close to the course
to interact with it in the same way as learners will. They can also be either
reluctant to provide feedback, or overly zealous.

If you do want a team member to be a beta tester, note that the privileges of
the Staff or Admin role override those of a beta tester. The team member must
use a different, second email address to create an additional account and
enroll in the course, and the course team must assign only the beta tester role
to that account. The course team member experiences the course as a learner
only when she signs in using the beta tester account.

.. _What_Test:

*********************************
What to Test
*********************************

Beta testers should interact with everything in the course.

* Select all links.

* Watch all videos.

* Download video transcripts and other files.

* Complete all problems.

Beta testers can use a desktop computer to access your course website, the
mobile app on a smartphone, or both to complete their tests. As they work,
beta testers log issues and questions for the course team.

.. _How_Testers_See_Course:

******************************************
How Beta Testers See Course Content
******************************************

To beta test a course, you:

* Define a number of days before content releases for testing to begin.

    * For instructor-paced courses, this number applies to the release date for
      each section and subsection. Beta testers can only access course content
      the number of days you specify before each section or subsection is
      released.

    * For self-paced courses, this number applies to the course start date.
      Because sections and subsections for self-paced courses do not have
      individual release dates, beta testers can access all course content when
      the beta test begins.

* Identify beta testers.

Designated beta testers see course content before learners can. The matrix
that follows shows the course content that beta testers can access earlier
than other learners in an example instructor-paced course.

The course team can continue to add content in Studio after the beta test
begins. When new content is ready for testing, be sure to :ref:`publish the
unit<Publish a Unit>`.

.. important:: When you set up the beta test and define when it starts, verify
 that the first section, subsection, and unit in your course are available to
 be tested. If that first unit is not available, an error occurs when testers
 attempt to access any other content in the course.
