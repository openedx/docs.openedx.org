What Are Divided Discussions?
******************************

With divided discussions, discussion topics are visible to all learners, but
the posts, responses, and comments within these topics are divided so that
learners participate in the discussion only with other members of the same
group (cohort).

Discussion topics that are not divided are unified, meaning that all learners
in the course can see and respond to posts, responses, and comments from any
other learner in the course.

=======================================
Best Practices for Divided Discussions
=======================================

If you divide discussions, a good practice is to use a naming convention for
discussion topics, so that learners clearly understand the audience for a
discussion topic before they add posts to that topic. For information about
naming conventions, see :ref:`Apply Naming Conventions to Discussion Topics`.

You can also appoint learners as Community TAs or Group Commmunity
TAs to help you to moderate course discussions. You might use Group
Community TAs if the content of discussion topics by one group (cohort) should not be
shared with another group. Group Community TAs are themselves members of
learner groups (cohorts) that you use in your course. As discussion moderators, they can
only see and respond to posts by other members of their own group (cohort). For information,
see :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

For more information about managing discussions, see :ref:`Managing Divided
Discussion Topics` and :ref:`Running_discussions`.

.. note::

  Another method of providing different discussion experiences for learners in
  different groups in your course is to use the access settings of discussion
  components. For example, you can add multiple discussion components and use
  each component's access settings to restrict access to each discussion
  component to a specific content group. You can then assign these content
  groups to learner groups (cohorts). For more information,
  see :ref:`Setting Up Divided Discussions`.
