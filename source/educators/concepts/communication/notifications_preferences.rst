which channel. You can get to the preferences page via:

- The Notifications section on the *Account Settings* page.
- The gear icon in the top-right corner of the notification tray.
- The *Notification Settings* link at the bottom of notifications in email.

For each preference, you can:

- Turn tray notifications on or off.
- Turn email notifications on or off.
- Choose an email cadence: Immediate, Daily, or Weekly


.. _notifications-grouping-educators:

Notifications Grouping
======================

Potentially high volume notifications, such as new discussion posts and new ORA submissions,
can clutter the notification tray. The notification grouping feature mitigates this issue by combining
similar notifications into a single one, based on their context. Currently, grouping is supported for
two notification types:

- New discussion posts: Notifications are grouped by the specific course.
- New ORA submission for staff review: Notifications are grouped by the ORA ID.

.. _notifications-expiry-educators:

Notifications Expiry
====================

Your site administrator may set a time limit for how long notifications remain available.
Once they reach that age, they are automatically removed from your notification tray.
