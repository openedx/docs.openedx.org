Best Practices for Providing Feedback

.. tags:: educator, concept

The immediacy of the feedback available to learners is a key advantage of
online instruction and difficult to do in a traditional classroom environment.

You can target feedback for common incorrect answers to the misconceptions that
are common for the level of the learner (for example, elementary, middle, high
school, college).

In addition, you can create feedback that provides some guidance to the learner
about how to arrive at the correct answer. This is especially important in text
input problems, because without such guidance, learners might
not be able to proceed.

You should also include feedback for the correct answer to reinforce why the
answer is correct. Especially in questions where learners are able to guess,
such as single select and dropdown problems, the feedback should provide a
reason why the selection is correct.
