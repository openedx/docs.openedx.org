Content Libraries v1 Overview

.. tags:: educator, concept

In Studio, you can create a library to build a pool of components for use in
randomized assignments in your courses. You can add Text components, problems,
and video components to a library. Open response assessment and discussion
components are not supported in libraries.

.. note:: Content libraries are available only for courses that have course
   identifiers in this format: ``{key type}:{org}+{course}+{run}``. For
   example, ``course-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_2015``. Your course identifier appears
   in the browser address bar as the final part of the URL when you open your
   course in Studio. For more details, see :ref:`Create a New Course`.

After creating a library and adding components to it, if you have :ref:`enabled
content libraries<Enable Content Libraries>` in your course, you can use these
library components in randomized assignments in your course. You do this by
adding a randomized content block to a course unit and specifying the name of
the library from which the randomized content is to drawn. You also specify the
number and type of problems that each learner is assigned. For information about randomized content blocks, see :ref:`Randomized Content Blocks`.

Libraries have separate users and levels of access from courses. Initially,
only the person who created the library has access. She can add other users to
the library. For details, see :ref:`Give Other Users Access to Your Library`.
The libraries that you create or have access to are listed on the **Libraries**
tab on the Studio Home page.
