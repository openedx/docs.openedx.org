.. tags:: educator, concept

The **Programs** page lists the programs that you have
enrolled in. You see a program on this page if you are enrolled in any courses
that are part of that program.

On the **Programs** page, you can perform the following actions.

* Access information about a program and enroll in more of the program's
  courses.

  To access information about a program, select that program. A page opens
  that provides details about the program, as well as links to enroll in or
  upgrade to the verified track in all courses in that program.

* View your progress for each program.

  Under the name of each program are indications of your progress through the
  program. You see the number of courses in the program that you have
  completed, the number of courses in the program that you are enrolled in,
  and the number of courses in the program that you are not yet enrolled in.

* Access any program certificates you have earned.

  In the right pane, a **Program Certificates** list shows the names of
  programs for which you have earned certificates. For more information about
  the program, or to view the certificate, select the name of the program.
