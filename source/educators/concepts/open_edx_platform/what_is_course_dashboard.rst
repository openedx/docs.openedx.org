What is the Course Dashboard?

.. tags:: educator, concept

Your dashboard lists all of the courses that you are enrolled in. When you
create an account or enroll in a course, you automatically go to your
dashboard. You can also access your dashboard by selecting the dropdown menu
icon next to your username at the top of any page.

     dropdown icon next to your username. The Dashboard option is circled, and
     the other options are Profile, Account, and Sign Out.

.. note:: Your dashboard is available only from the LMS. If you are currently
  working in Studio, view the live version of your course to access your
  dashboard.

You can find information about your courses and change course-specific email
subscription settings on your dashboard. For more information, see :doc:`update_course_specific_settings <../../how-tos/update_course_specific_settings>`.

The dashboard has two main pages.

*   The **Courses** page provides information about your courses and allows you to change course settings. By
    default, the dashboard opens to the **Courses** page. The **Courses** page on the dashboard now includes two main categories of filters with subcategories in each main category. **Course Status** includes 'In progress,' 'Not Started,' 'Done,' 'Not Enrolled,' and 'Upgraded.' These different filters allow you to filter all of the courses based on the course status. **Sort** includes 'Last enrolled' and 'Title (A-Z).' These filters allow you to filter the course alphabetically or when you were last enrolled in the course.

*  The **Programs** page lists any programs offer by your Open edX instance for courses that you are enrolled in. Programs appear on this page if you are enrolled in any course that is part of that program. This page also shows how many courses in the program you have completed, how many are in progres, and the number of remaining courses you have left in the program.
