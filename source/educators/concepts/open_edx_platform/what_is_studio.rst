Studio is the tool you use to build your courses.

You use Studio to create a course structure, and then add problems, videos, and
other resources for learners.

With Studio, you can also manage the course schedule, identify members of the
course team, set the grading policy, publish your course, and more.

You use Studio directly through your browser. You do not need any additional
software.
