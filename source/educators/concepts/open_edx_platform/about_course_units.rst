.. _What is a Unit:

****************************
What is a Unit?
****************************

A unit is a part of a :ref:`subsection<About Course Subsections>` that
learners view as a single page.

A unit contains one or more :ref:`components<Add a Component>`,
such as text with :ref:`HTML<About Text Components>` markup,
:ref:`problems<Working with Problem Components>`, or a
:ref:`video<Working with Video Components>`.


****************************
Viewing the Unit Page
****************************

In Studio, when a unit name is selected in the outline, the **Unit** page opens.

The following example shows a unit page in Studio with one component, with
boxes and text to show different areas and controls in the page.

   in-context analytics (if :ref:`Aspects Home` is enabled).

****************************
Viewing Units as a Learner
****************************

To a learner using the learning management system (LMS), each unit in the
subsection is listed in the collapsable navigation bar on the left side of the
**Course** page. The current unit is indicated with slight highlighting in the
sidebar. The components in the current unit appear to the right of the sidebar
navigation.

The following image shows a subsection in the LMS that contains several units.

the unit. A learner has completed the unit if the learner has completed all the
following actions.
