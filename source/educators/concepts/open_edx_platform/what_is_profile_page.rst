.. tags:: educator, concept

Your personal profile allows you to optionally share information about yourself
with other participants in the courses that you take. If you choose to add
profile information, course teams and other learners in your courses can view
the information that you share.

You can share either a limited profile or a full profile.

  .. note:: If you are under 13 years of age, your limited profile only
     includes your username. You cannot add a profile picture.

* A limited profile shares only your username. You can also add a profile
  picture, if you are over 13 years of age.
