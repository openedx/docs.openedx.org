The LMS is the web-based tool where you view the courses you have created in
Studio.

If you have not created a course, see :ref:`Creating a New Course<Create a New Course>`.

#. In Studio, locate your course on your dashboard and open your course.

#. On the **Course Outline** page, select **View Live**.

#. After clicking **View Live**, the course opens in the LMS page.

To continue working on your course, return to the browser tab that shows
Studio.
