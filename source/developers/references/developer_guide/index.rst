Welcome to the Open edX Developer's Guide. This guide should be
used as a reference manual; it covers everything from high level
system architecture to practical advice on testing and coding for
internationalization.

This reference guide to contributing code to the Open edX project is
comprehensive and covers all you might encounter in the process of writing,
submitting, and getting reviews on your pull requests. Before diving into this
guide, you might find it useful to check out the :ref:`qs Dev First PR`, and
its follow-up, :ref:`qs Dev Contributing`.
