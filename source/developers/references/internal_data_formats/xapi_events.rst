xAPI Events

`xAPI`_ is an open standard created by the `Advanced Distributed Learning`_ initiative.
Open edX supports sending some xAPI events (called statements) to a Learning Record
Store. This functionality is off by default and requires installing the
event-routing-backends plugin.

The `supported xAPI events`_ are maintained in the plugin's GitHub repository.

For more information, see the `event-routing-backends documentation`_.
