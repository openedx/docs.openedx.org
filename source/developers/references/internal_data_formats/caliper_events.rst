`Caliper`_ is an standard created by `IMS Global`_.
Open edX supports sending some Caliper events to an EventStore. This
functionality is off by default and requires installing the
event-routing-backends plugin.

The `supported Caliper events`_ are maintained in the plugin's GitHub repository.

For more information, see the `event-routing-backends documentation`_.
