   :class: no-bullets

Welcome to the Quickstart guide for new Open edX contributors. By the end of
this tutorial, you will have completed all the steps necessary to begin
contributing to the Open edX project.

These include:

* Setting up your development environment;
* Making your first commit;
* Submitting your first pull request (PR);
* `Signing your Contributor License Agreement (CLA).`_

We assume you are comfortable with the command line, and understand the basics
of using Git, GitHub, and python basics.

.. This Quickstart is written for first-time contributors to the Open edX project.
   If you are a plug-in developer or a frontend developer, please see our
   :doc:`Quickstart guide for plug-in developers <setup_a_plugin_dev_environment>`
   or our :doc:`Quickstart for frontend developers <setup_an_mfe_dev_environment>`.

Before you start
****************

.. admonition:: System Requirements

   For the smoothest experience, we recommend that your computer has at least
   **16 GB of RAM, 2 CPUs, and at least 50 GB of Free disk space**.

This tutorial is written for users of macOS or Linux.
It has been tested with both common 64-bit processor families:
x86-64 (a.k.a. Intel-64) and ARM-64 (used in newer Apple laptops, including M1, M2, etc.).
Additionally,
you will need to have the following installed or configured, and know at least
the basics of using them, before proceeding:

* Git (see `GitHub's set up Git guide
  <https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git>`_)

* A `GitHub account <https://github.com/signup>`_

  * Additionally, we strongly recommend setting up 2-factor authentication.

* `Python 3.8 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_

* Your favorite code editor (our team uses
  `VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_,
  `Emacs for Mac OS X <https://emacsformacosx.com/>`_,
  `NeoVim <https://neovim.io/>`_,
  `MacVim <https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim>`_,
  and others)

.. _homebrew: https://brew.sh

Install Docker
**************

Install `Docker Desktop <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/>`_ and launch
it. You can check that it is running correctly with::

    docker run --rm hello-world

You should see a message that starts with the following::

   Hello from Docker!
   This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

On macOS, by default, Docker allocates at most 2 GB of RAM to containers; the
Open edX software requires at least 8 GB. macOS users should follow these instructions
from the `official Docker documentation
<https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced>`_ to allocate at least 8 GB
to the Docker daemon.


Installing Tutor Nightly
************************

Navigate into a folder to hold your Open edX repositories.
We will assume you're using ``~/openedx``, but you can choose any folder.

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir -p ~/openedx
  cd ~/openedx

Create a Python 3.8 virtual environment (we'll call it ``tutor-venv``) and activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

  python3.8 -m venv tutor-venv
  . tutor-venv/bin/activate

Install Tutor. This is a tool that helps you run the Open edX project.
We will install the "Nightly" version of Tutor, which means it will run the latest
version of the code (as opposed to the most recent named release):

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone --branch=nightly https://github.com/overhangio/tutor.git
  pip install -e "./tutor[full]"

Finally, let's configure and provision your Open edX instance!
You will be asked a couple questions.
Answer them however you like, although the default answers will work fine.

.. code-block:: bash

  tutor dev launch

Depending on your system and your Internet connection speed,
this could take anywhere from five minutes to over an hour,
so go get a coffee and come back for the next part.


Working with a fork
*******************

At this point you should have a Tutor installation that is suitable for
development, but you're still missing a practical way to edit the code, test
it locally, and then contribute it back.

For the purposes of this tutorial, you'll be modifying code in the
``edx-platform`` repository, where the Open edX backend code lives.  Let's
start by creating your own personal "fork" of it. A "fork" is essentially your
own copy of the repository. `See here <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_ to learn more about forks.

Forking edx-platform
====================

Assuming you're logged in to GitHub, forking a repository is easy.  Visit the
``edx-platform`` repository at this URL:

https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform

Now, click the :guilabel:`Fork` button on the top right, and in the next
screen, select your personal account as the owner.  After you click the
:guilabel:`Create fork` button, you'll be taken to your own version of the
``edx-platform`` repository.

Cloning your fork
=================

Your ``edx-platform`` currently only exists on the GitHub servers.  You'll now
create a local copy of it (a "clone").

First, fetch the git URL of your fork.  Navigate to its web page (to which you
were taken after creation), click on the :guilabel:`Code` button, select
the **HTTPS** tab, and copy the URL given.  It should look like this::

   https://github.com:<your_github_username>/edx-platform.git

Now, from the same top level directory you created above, clone the repository
as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/openedx
   git clone  https://github.com:<your_github_username>/edx-platform.git

You'll now have an ``edx-platform`` directory containing a local clone of your
fork.  It is not yet wired into your Tutor development environment, though.
This is what you'll do next.

Mounting edx-platform
=====================

To have Tutor run your local fork of edx-platform, you have to tell it to do so
on start up.  It is a simple CLI parameter that points Tutor to the directory where
the code lives.

As a first step, fire up a one-off LMS container while mounting your local
checkout:

.. code-block:: bash

   tutor dev run --mount=./edx-platform lms bash

Now within the container, install python requirements and rebuild static assets
for your local checkout:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .
   npm install
   openedx-assets build --env=dev
   exit

After exiting the one-off container, restart the LMS with the local checkout
mounted:

.. code-block:: bash

   tutor dev start --mount=./edx-platform lms

From this point on, whatever changes you make to the code in your clone should
be visible in your local LMS instance immediately.

Exercise: Update the Learner Dashboard
**************************************

The Learner Dashboard is the first page that students will see when they log
into Open edX. On our Tutor dev environment, it is located at
``http://local.overhang.io:8000/dashboard``

.. image:: /_images/developers_quickstart_first_pr/learner_dashboard_before.png
   :alt: Learner Dashboard page without any of our changes.

As an exercise, you're going to make a small edit to the top of this page. This
is not a change that will be merged upstream, but it will demonstrate the
steps you will have to go through to make a real change.

Edit the Template
=================

The template file for this page is at ``lms/templates/dashboard.html``. We're
going to add a simple welcome message to the ``dashboard-notifications`` div::

    <div class="dashboard-notifications" tabindex="-1">
        <!-- start new content -->

        Welcome to your dashboard!

        <!-- end new content -->

Feel free to replace the welcome text with any message you'd like and save the
file. When you reload it in your browser, you should see something like this:

.. image:: /_images/developers_quickstart_first_pr/learner_dashboard_after.png
   :alt: Learner Dashboard page after we add the welcome message.

Make a Commit
=============

Now that you've saved your changes, you can make a commit. First make a new
branch with the name ``developer_quickstart``::

    git checkout -b developer_quickstart

Then we can create the actual commit. Note that Open edX commit messages should
follow our `conventional commit <https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0051-bp-conventional-commits.html>`_
practices. In our case, we're making a new feature, so our commit message must
be prefixed with "feat:" like so::

    commit -a -m "feat: add welcome message to learner dashboard"

Push the Commit to Your Fork
============================

Now push your changes to a new branch in your fork::

    git push --set-upstream origin developer_quickstart

If you get a ``fatal: Authentication failed`` error, authenticate Git Hub by running::

   gh auth login

Learn more about authentication `here <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github#about-authentication-to-github>`_.


Create A Pull Request
*********************

Go to your fork.

https://github.com/<your_github_username>/edx-platform

At the top of the page you'll see a section that will suggest that you make a
new pull request.  Go ahead and click the big green button.

.. image:: /_images/developers_quickstart_first_pr/new_pull_request_suggestion.png
   :alt: Screenshot of the Review and Create Pull Request button.

This will bring up a form which you don't need to make any changes in for now.
Go ahead hit "Create Pull Request" again.

.. image:: /_images/developers_quickstart_first_pr/pull_request_form.png
   :alt: Screenshot of the Pull Request Form with "Create Pull Request" highlighted.

Congratulations, you have made a new pull request for a change against the
Open edX project!

Because this was a practice PR, it will be closed without the changes being
accepted.  This is so others can continue to go through the same quickstart.

However for any real changes you make in the future, you can expect that the
reviewers will review your changes and may ask for changes or accept your
changes as is and merge them.
