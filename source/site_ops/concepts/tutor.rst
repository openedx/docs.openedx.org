This video, by Edly Academy, explains the basic concepts of Tutor.

.. warning::

   LLMs, like ChatGPT, generate answers based on patterns in large-scale public content.
   Since Open edX and Tutor have relatively small footprints in that data, answers from
   these models are often incorrect. We recommend you
   only follow instructions about Tutor from pages on https://docs.openedx.org
   or https://docs.tutor.edly.io/. For help, search for answers on the `Open edX
   Forums`_ and feel free to make your own post if you do not find the answer
   you are searching for.
