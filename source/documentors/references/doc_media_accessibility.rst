Introduction
*************

Sometimes, it can be helpful to start any discussion on media accessibility by dispelling common myths and talking about the challenges people with disabilities face when consuming media before talking about the solutions. The following information is about how people with disabilities consume media, what their challenges are, and how authors can provide solutions.

Blindness
*********

People who are blind cannot access the visual information contained in videos. The visual medium is inherently inaccessible to those who cannot see. However, audio and digital text are still very accessible. In accessibility, we often talk about "alternative content." Audio and text can efficiently serve as alternative content for blind people. Good alternative content is equivalent content. Content is comparable to others when both fulfill the same function or purpose when presented to the user.

Things to Keep in Mind
======================
Here are a few things to keep in mind when creating media for your courses.

* Vocalize any print that appears in your video.

* Explain visual events that are important to the context of the video. This will improve the quality of your material, ensuring that all students understand the significance of what they are observing.

* Avoid using phrases like "over here we have..." or "this number..." that rely on a visual cue to comprehend.

How These Techniques Can Benefit a Broader Audience
====================================================

Learners increasingly consume media while performing other tasks, such as driving, doing household chores, and so on, and may be unable to focus on the video content. Try listening to only the audio track from your video. Is the information presented "equivalent"?

.. note:: About blindness, it is essential to drive home the fact that if you do not vocalize unspoken visual events that are important to understanding the video, you will trigger a requirement to provide :ref:`audio descriptions<Audio Description>`, which is both expensive and time-consuming.

Low Vision
**********

People with low vision can access some visual information. Depending on their visual ability, they might have specific issues, such as difficulty discerning foreground information from background information or between colors. They may be unable to react quickly to transient information. They may have a narrow angle of view and may not detect essential temporary information presented where they are not looking or in moving or scrolling text.

A person with low vision is likely to use screen magnification software. This means they will only be viewing a portion of the screen and must manage tracking media content. 

Others with low vision may have difficulty reading when text is too small, has poor background contrast, or when decorative fonts or effects are used. Users with low vision often benefit from the same vocalization techniques used to provide access to those who are blind.

Things to Keep in Mind
======================
* Ensure important visual content remains on the screen long enough to be processed.

* Consider contrast and lighting when choosing settings and adding visual content.

* Use as much of the viewport as possible to present information.

* Be consistent with the placement of important visual information.

How These Techniques Can Benefit a Broader Audience
====================================================

Multimedia is increasingly consumed on mobile devices with a tiny viewport. The abovementioned techniques will benefit users who consume your content on a mobile device.

Deafness
********

Generally, people who are deaf cannot access the audio content of your media. As a result, you will need to add an alternative format. You can provide this in the Open edX videos through synchronized captions. 

Things to Keep in Mind
======================

When creating timed-text caption files, be sure to include descriptions of
audible, non-speech content that is important to comprehend the video (such as [APPLAUSE], [BUZZER], [ASCENDING TONE]). The text should "fulfill the same function or purpose" as the audio.

How These Techniques Can Benefit a Broader Audience
===================================================

Captions are helpful for those who speak a different language than the speaker in the video. Onscreen text is more accessible to comprehend than spoken words. Captions can also be translated into other languages very easily.

Hard of Hearing
***************

People who are hard of hearing may be able to access some audio material but might not discern certain types of sound. They may miss any information presented as audio only if it contains frequencies they can't hear or is masked by background noise or distortion. They may miss audio, which is too quiet or of poor quality. People with cochlear implants may not have issues with audio volume levels, but comprehension may be challenging if the media experience is overwhelming. People who are deaf or hard of hearing may also read lips.

Things to Keep in Mind
======================

* Speak loudly and clearly.

* Try to face the camera as much as possible when speaking onscreen.

* Avoid background noise or music that competes with the primary audio.

Most people are unfamiliar with `audio descriptions`_ and this reference will provide important information about them. It also is relevant to know the `WCAG 2 0 guidelines`_.
