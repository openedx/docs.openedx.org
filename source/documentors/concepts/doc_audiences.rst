Documentation Audiences
#######################

Open edX documentation is organized by the following audiences:

* **Educators**, who build online courses using Studio.

* **Course Operators**, who run online courses, using features in the LMS.

* **Site Operators**, who install and configure Open edX.

* **Developers**, who contribute new features or bug fixes to the core Open edX platform, or develop other components and XBlocks that integrate with the core platform.

When you develop new documentation, you should identify the audience(s) who need the information. Some platform changes may need you to address multiple audiences. For example, a new feature may require instructions for Site Operators to enable it, and for Educators to use it in a course.
