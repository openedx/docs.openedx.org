Use the following instructions when you are viewing the published documentation on
``docs.openedx.org`` and you want to make changes to it.

#. On the page you want to edit, under the GitHub icon in the header, |GitHub Icon|, select :guilabel:`suggest edit`.

#. Make the necessary changes.

   Ensure you keep to RST standards in file.  See the :doc:`../references/quick_reference_rst` a quick reference to RST.

#. In the **Propose changes** section at the bottom of the edit window:

   #. Add a comment about the addition you made.

   #. Optionally, add a longer description.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Propose changes` to save these changes to your fork.

GitHub then creates a *fork* of the repository that belongs to your account.  A fork is a complete copy of the repository, plus your changes. For more information, see `Github Forks`_.

GitHub then prompts you to create a pull request, which is a request for the Open edX team to integrate changes in your fork into the official repository.
