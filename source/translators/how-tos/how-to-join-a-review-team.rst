How to join a review team
#########################

Once you have a little practice translating for Open edX, you can optionally request to
become a reviewer for a language. Review teams are incredibly important because all
strings must be both translated and reviewed before they are published.

You should only join a review team, if you feel confident in both your selected target
language and in English. To join a review team, request permission from the project
coordinator(s):

On the Transifex edx-platform project page for your selected target language, click
“Members”:

* A list of the current members of that translation team appears.
* Select one of the language coordinators to open the Transifex profile page, where you can
  select “Send message” to send an email message asking for reviewer access.
* If the coordinator does not respond, try sending a message to another language
  coordinator. You can also send a message to one of the Open edX project maintainers.
  The project maintainers appear at the top of the main project page.
* If you are willing to become a coordinator for a language, let us know in your message!
* You can also obtain reviewer and coordinator access by contacting the Translation
  Working Group’s Organizer via email.
