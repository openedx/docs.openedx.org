How to join a review team
#########################

Once you have a little practice translating for Open edX, you can optionally request to
become a reviewer for a language. Review teams are incredibly important because all
strings must be both translated and reviewed before they are published.

Assumptions
***********

* You are confident in your selected target language.

* You are confident in English

Steps
*****

To join a review team, request permission from the project coordinator(s):

#. On the Transifex edx-platform project page for your selected target language,
   click “Members”.  A list of the current members of that translation team should appear.

#. Select one of the language coordinators to open the Transifex profile page,
   where you can select “Send message” to send an email message asking for
   reviewer access. If you are willing to become a coordinator for a language,
   let us know in your message!

.. note:: If the coordinator does not respond, try sending a message to another
   language coordinator. You can also send a message to one of the Open edX
   project maintainers. The project maintainers appear at the top of the main
   project page.

   You can also obtain reviewer and coordinator access by contacting the
   Translation Working Group’s Organizer via ``ehuthmacher at axim dot org``.
