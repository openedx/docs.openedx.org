How to request a new language for translation
#############################################

If the language you are interested in contributing translations for is not listed on the
Transifex edx-platform project page, select the option “Request language” to start a new
translation project for your target language.

Before you request a new language, please make sure that the language is not already
listed. Keep in mind that variants of a language might exist in the list of translation
projects (“Chinese” versus “Chinese-China”) and one of these variants may meet your needs.
An edX translation team member will respond to your request within a few days. If the
language that you request is approved, you become the coordinator of the project. You can
add additional coordinators, reviewers, and translators as you wish.

If you request a new language, we ask that you commit to the success of your language’s
translation project. Particularly, we expect you to be an active translator and work to
recruit other translators and reviewers so that the translation project for your target
language advances to completion, with all strings translated and reviewed, so that we can
publish your work to the Open edX community.
