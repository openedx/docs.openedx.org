How to request a new language for translation
#############################################

Assumptions
***********

* The language you are interested in is not listed on the Transifex
  `edx-platform project page`_.

* A variant of the language that may meet your needs is also not listed
  (``Chinese`` vs ``Chinese-China``).


* If you request a new language, we ask that you commit to the success of your
  languageâ€™s translation project. Particularly, we expect you to:

  * Be an active translator

  * Work to recruit other translators and reviewers

  You will be responsible for advancing your target language to completion, with
  all strings translated and reviewed, so that we can publish your work to the
  Open edX community.

Steps
*****

#. Go to the `edx-platform project page`_

#. Select the option :guilabel:`Request language` to start a new translation
   project for your target language.

#. Wait for an edX translation team member to
   respond to your request within a few days.

#. If the language that you request
   is approved, you become the coordinator of the project. You can add
   additional coordinators, reviewers, and translators as you wish.
