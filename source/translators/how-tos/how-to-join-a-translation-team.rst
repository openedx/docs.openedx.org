How to join a translation team
##############################

In order to help translate Open edX projects, you must first join a translation team
for the language you wish to translate to. We use `Transifex`_ to allow our community
to collaborate on translations. More detailed instructions for how to get involved in
translations are located in the
:ref:`How to start translating for Open edX` page.

Steps
*****
To join a translation team you must complete these steps:

#. Sign up for a `Transifex Signup`_ account and read through their `getting
   started guide`_. For help getting started with Transifex, please review their
   `Translating with the Web Editor`_ page, and get familiar with the roles and permissions
   as documented in `Understanding User Roles`_. You will start off in the "Translator"
   role.

#. Join the Transifex `openedx-translations project`_ with the language(s) you wish
   to translate to. Please be proficient in both English and the language you wish to
   translate to! If that language does not yet exist, you may follow the directions
   in :ref:`How to request a new language for translation` to add it.

#. Join the Open edX Slack or Discuss. Links to join are available at the
   `Open edX Community`_ page. Translation help is available in the
   ``#translations-working-group`` Slack channel!
