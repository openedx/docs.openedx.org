There are four notification preferences for Discussions:

1. **Activity notifications**: Notifies you of all activity related to posts or responses you've authored or are following.
2. **New posts from instructors**: Notifies you when an instructor creates a post.
3. **New discussion posts**: Notifies you when someone creates a new discussion type post.
4. **New question posts**: Notifies you when someone creates a new question type post.

Table below shows which activity types trigger notifications. Several activity types are
grouped into a single preference to avoid clutter in preferences.
