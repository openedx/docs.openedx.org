There are four notification preferences for Discussions:

1. **Activity notifications**: Cover all activity related to your own posts, responses, and followed threads.  
2. **New question posts**: Alerts you when someone creates a new question type post in your course.
3. **New discussion posts**: Alerts you when someone creates a new discussion type post.
4. **New posts from instructors**: Notifies you when an instructor or staff member creates a post.

The tables below shows who receives each notification by default.
