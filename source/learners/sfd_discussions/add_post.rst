.. _Creating a post:

***************
Creating a post
***************

A post starts a new conversation.

1. Choose the right **type** before you post:

   a. **Question:** when you need an answer or clarification.  
   b. **Discussion:** when you want to share an idea or start a conversation.

2. Select a **topic** that fits your post so others can find it easily.

3. Add a short, clear **title** that describes what your post is about.

4. Write your **description**. Use the toolbar to format text or insert images if needed.

5. Click **Show preview** (bottom-right corner) to check your post before submitting.

6. If anonymous posting is enabled, you will see a **Post anonymously to peers** checkbox.  
   When selected, your post appears **anonymous to peers**, but your identity remains  
   **visible to course staff and teaching assistants**. Use this option thoughtfully.

7. Click **Submit** to publish your post. You can edit it later if needed.

************************************
Editing or deleting your own content
************************************

You can edit or delete any post, response, or comment that you’ve authored. Use the actions menu on your 
contribution to make changes. Be careful when deleting because removing a post or response also deletes all 
responses or comments associated with it.

.. _Report content:

*******************************
Reporting inappropriate content
*******************************

If you see a post, response, or comment that is inappropriate or spam, report it for review. 
Open the actions menu on that item and select Report. Course moderators will review and take any needed action. 
Reporting content helps keep discussions safe and respectful.

*************************************
Endorse a response or mark as answer
*************************************

Forum moderators can endorse responses in discussion posts or mark them as the answer in question posts. 
Endorsed or marked responses highlight information that is accurate or especially helpful, and they appear with 
a visual indicator so others can recognize trusted answers quickly.

As the author of a question post, you can also mark a response as the answer yourself.

.. note::
  You receive a notification if your response is endorsed or marked as the answer, or if a response on 
  your own post is endorsed or marked as the answer., see :ref:`Staying Updated with Notifications <staying-updated-with-notifications>`.

Forum moderators can close a post to prevent further responses or comments. A closed post displays a lock icon 
at the bottom-right corner. If you are the post’s author, a banner appears at the top explaining why the post 
was closed.

Moderators may close posts that are off-topic, duplicates, resolved, or contain content related to assignments 
or exams that could reveal solutions. Moderators can reopen a closed post.
