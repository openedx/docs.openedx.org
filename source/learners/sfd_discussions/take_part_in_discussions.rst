   Creating a discussion post on the Discussions page and in a course unit.

A post starts a new conversation.

1. Choose the right type before you post:

   - **Question:** when you need an answer or clarification.  
   - **Discussion:** when you want to share an idea or start a conversation.

2. Select a topic that fits your post so others can find it easily.

3. Add a short, clear title that describes what your post is about.

4. Write your description. Use the toolbar to format text or insert images if needed.

5. Click *Show preview* (bottom right corner) to check your post before submitting.

6. If anonymous posting is enabled, you will see a *Post anonymously to peers* checkbox.
   When selected, your post appears anonymous to peers, but your identity remains visible to course staff and moderators.
   Some courses do not allow anonymous posting.

7. Click *Submit* to publish your post. You can edit it later if needed.
