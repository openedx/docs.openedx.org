*************************
Creating a post
*************************

A post starts a new conversation.

1. Choose the right **type** before you post:
   - **Question:** when you need an answer or clarification.  
   - **Discussion:** when you want to share an idea or start a conversation.

2. Select a **topic** that fits your post so others can find it easily.

3. Add a short, clear **title** that describes what your post is about.

4. Write your **description**. Use the toolbar to format text or insert images if needed.

5. Click **Show preview** (bottom right corner) to check your post before submitting.

6. If anonymous posting is enabled, you will see a **Post anonymously to peers** checkbox.  
   When selected, your post appears **anonymous to peers**, but your identity remains **visible to course staff and moderators**.  
   Some courses do not allow anonymous posting.

7. Click **Submit** to publish your post. You can edit it later if needed.

.. note::
   You can subscribe to notifications for new discussions or new question posts from the Preference Center.  
   See :ref:`Staying Updated with Notifications <staying-updated-with-notifications>`.

**Next:** Learn how to respond and comment.

*************************
Responding and commenting
*************************

You can add to an existing conversation by writing a **response** or a **comment**.

- A **response** adds your full reply or answer to the main post.  
- A **comment** adds a short note or clarification inside a specific response.

Open a post, write your response or comment, and click **Submit**.  
Read the thread first so your reply fits naturally into the discussion.

.. note::
   You will receive a notification when someone creates a response or a comment on your post or response.  
   See :ref:`Staying Updated with Notifications <staying-updated-with-notifications>`.

**Next:** Learn how answers and endorsements work.

*******************************************
Endorsements and accepted answers
*******************************************

Forum moderators can endorse responses in discussion posts or mark them as the **answer** in question posts.  
Endorsed or marked responses highlight accurate or especially helpful information, and appear with a visual indicator.

If you created a question post, you can mark a response as the answer yourself.

.. note::
   You will receive a notification if your response is endorsed or marked as the answer,  
   or if a response on your post is endorsed or marked as the answer.  
   See :ref:`Staying Updated with Notifications <staying-updated-with-notifications>`.

**Next:** Learn how to edit or remove your contributions.

********************************************
Editing or deleting your own contributions
********************************************

You can edit or delete any post, response, or comment that you have written.  
Use the **Actions** menu on your contribution to make changes.

Be careful when deleting content:

- Deleting a **post** removes all its responses and comments.  
- Deleting a **response** removes its comments.  
- Deleting a **comment** affects only that comment.

*******************************
Reporting inappropriate content
*******************************

If you see a post, response, or comment that is inappropriate, off-topic, or spam, report it for review.  
Open the **Actions** menu on that item and select **Report**.

Moderators review reported content and may edit, hide, or close it to keep discussions safe and respectful.

Moderation actions
******************************

Moderators help maintain a respectful learning environment.  
They can close posts to prevent new replies or edit posts to correct or remove sensitive information.

===========================
When a post is closed
===========================

A closed post shows a **lock icon** at the bottom right corner.  
If you are the author, a banner appears at the top explaining why the post was closed.

Moderators may close posts that are off-topic, duplicates, resolved, or related to graded assignments or exams.  
Closed posts can be reopened by moderators if needed.
