********************************
Navigating the Discussions page
********************************

When you open the Discussions tab in your course, you see four tabs at the top, as shown in the image below. 

1. **My Posts:** Shows all posts that you’ve written or taken part in through a response or comment. Click a post title in the left panel to open it and see its responses and comments.

2. **All Posts:** Lists every post in the course forums. By default, posts with the most recent activity appear at the top.

3. **Topics:** Displays all discussion topics in the course. Topics follow the same three-level hierarchy as the course content:
   
   a. The top level represents course sections.  
   b. The second level shows subsections.  
   c. The third level lists units, which are the actual discussion topics that contain posts. Select a subsection to expand it and see its topics. When you click a topic name, you will see the posts related to it.

4. **Learners:** Shows everyone who has written a post, response, or comment. Click a learner’s name to see their contributions. Under each name you can see the number of posts they created and their total contributions.

.. note:: Use *My Posts* for tracking your own activity and *Topics* when you want to focus on the part of the course you are studying.

*********************************
Discussions inside course units
*********************************

Some course units have a discussion panel on the right side of the page. This panel only shows posts linked to that 
unit’s topic. It is a focused view for that specific content. Posts made here also appear in the  main Discussions page.

.. note:: Use the inline panel when you want to talk about something shown on the page. 
   Use the main Discussions tab when you want to search or browse across the entire course.

Viewing pinned and followed posts
*****************************************

Pinned posts stay at the top of every list. They often contain key announcements or resources from the course team. 

Posts you are following display a filled star icon. To view only those, open the *All Posts* tab and apply the 
*Following* filter. Follow posts that relate to your project or assignment so that you get updates 
when new responses arrive.

.. note:: You will receive notifications of any activity on posts that you are following. Learn more in :ref:`Staying Updated with Notifications <staying-updated-with-notifications>`.
