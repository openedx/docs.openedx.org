**************************
Where to Find Discussions
**************************

You can access course discussions in two ways:

==============================
1. From the course navigation
==============================

Click the “Discussions” tab at the top of your course. This opens the full discussion page, 
where you can browse all topics, search, and post new questions/discussions.

==============================
2. From inside a course unit
==============================

Some course units have their own mini discussion panel on the right side of the page. 
Use this to create or participate in discussion specific to that course unit. 
If you don’t see this panel, it means discussions haven’t been enabled for that unit 
(very likely for assignments or exams). You can still use the main “Discussions” tab.

Remember, this panel only includes posts for that specific course unit. You’ll learn more 
about browsing and searching all course discussions on the next page.

Basic Elements

Each discussion has the following components:

* Post: The question or idea that someone shares. A post starts a discussion. It has a title, name of the author, its type (question or discussion) and the topic it is linked to. 

* Responses: Other learners or course staff can write responses to a post. Responses add explanations, share experiences, or suggest solutions. They sit directly under the original post.

* Comments: Within each response, learners can add comments. These are follow-ups that keep side conversations contained and easy to read.
Comments add context within a single response.

* Topics: A topic indicates what the post is about. Every post belongs to a topic. Topics group related discussions together and help you browse and keep course conversations organized. For example, Week 2: Problem Set 1, General Questions, or Feedback.
