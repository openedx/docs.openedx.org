Delivery Channels
#################

Tray
****

- The intention of the notification tray is to keep users informed while they're on the web platform.
- A bell icon in the top-right corner displays the count of unread notifications.
- When clicked, it opens a tray that organizes notifications into tabs based on platform area (Discussions, Grading, Updates).
- Each notification includes the relevant course's name, a red dot to indicate it's unread (not clicked), and a timestamp showing when it was generated.
- A gear icon in the tray's top-right corner links to the preferences center, where users can adjust their notification settings.

Default Settings
*****************

- High-value notifications have tray and email ON by default.

  - “New posts from instructors” and “Course updates” are exceptions where email is OFF by default to prevent high volume/cost of email due to courses with large enrollments.

- High-volume notifications (e.g., new discussion posts) are OFF by default to prevent clutter.
- Email cadence default is set to “Daily” for all preferences where email default ON.

The table below shows defaults for each notification type.
