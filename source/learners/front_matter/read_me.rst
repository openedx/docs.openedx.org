The *Open edX Learner's Guide* is created for learners on the Open edX platform, and answers common questions about topics like getting started in an online course, earning certificates, participating in course discussions, and completing some of the exercises you may see in your course.

This documentation is created using RST_ files and Sphinx_. The Open edX community welcomes contributions from Open edX community
members. You can find guidelines for how to :ref:`contribute to Open edX Documentation<Documentor Guidelines>`.

You can also find additional resources for learners in the :ref:`Resources for Open edX Learners` section.
