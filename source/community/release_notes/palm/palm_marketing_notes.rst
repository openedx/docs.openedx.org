Open edX Palm Release (June 2023)
########################################

Welcome to the Palm release! Discover new and exciting features for authors,
learners, and site operators. Here's what's ready for you now:

🧑‍🏫 For Course Authors
********************************

:ref:`Redesigned Problem Editor<Palm Editor Improvements>`:
Create and edit problems in a full-screen visual editor without writing
Markdown. The new editor features answer options, scoring, and settings all in
one place, plus live previews and easy access to advanced OLX when you need it.

:ref:`Streamlined ORA Grading <Palm ORA grading>`:
Grade open response assessments faster with side-by-side rubrics, file previews
(PDFs, images, text), team coordination features, and batch grading — all in one
intuitive interface that lets you review multiple submissions without switching
screens.

:ref:`Issue Verifiable Digital Credentials <Palm credentials>`:
Learners can now share tamper-proof, instantly verifiable program credentials to
digital wallets, giving them portable proof of accomplishments they control and
can present to employers, schools, or anyone they choose in seconds.

:ref:`Schedule Emails to Students <Palm bulk email>`:
Instructors can now schedule course emails to send later instead of immediately.
This is perfect for timing announcements, reminders, and updates when students
are most likely to engage.

🎓 For Learners
*****************

:ref:`Enhanced Discussions Experience <Palm discussions>`:
Improved accessibility, faster loading times, and a Discussions "Product Tour"
have been introduced to the Discussions application.

⚙️ For Site Operators 
**********************

:ref:`The Rate XBlock <DEPR Rate>` is no longer supported. We recommend using the
`Feedback XBlock <https://github.com/openedx/FeedbackXBlock>`_.

🔮 Upcoming in Quince (December 2023)
**************************************

We're working hard on even more improvements in our :ref:`Quince release (out
now) <Quince Product Marketing Notes>`! You can look forward to:

**Copy & Paste Course Components**: Reuse text blocks, problems, videos, and
full course units across courses in seconds by copying to a clipboard and
pasting it wherever you need it, cutting down content creation time
dramatically.

**New DemoX Course**: The new DemoX course will provide five modules that
advance from general to specific knowledge and provide reusable blocks that you
can repurpose for your own courses.

**Redesigned Learner Home**: Learners will have a sleek, modern hub to view
enrolled courses, filter by status, sort by date or title, and quickly resume
learning.

**Discussions Right Where You Need Them**: Learners will be able to view,
respond to, and start discussion threads directly within course units via a
collapsible sidebar - no more navigating away from content to join the
conversation.

**Sell Courses with WooCommerce**: An integration with WooCommerce will let you
create course products, process enrollments, handle refunds, and manage seats
without maintaining your own ecommerce infrastructure.
