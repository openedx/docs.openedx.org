.. _Teak Product Marketing Notes:

Open edX Teak Release (June 2025)
###################################

Welcome to the Teak release! This release puts powerful new tools in your hands
while making everyday tasks simpler. Here's what's ready for you now: 

🧑‍🏫 For Course Authors
********************************

:ref:`Easier Content Reuse with Libraries <Content Libraries Redesign Teak>`: Using
Libraries, authors can now create modular units that can be
reused in multiple courses. Updates and changes to content can be managed
centrally in Libraries, with changes syncing seamlessly. Save hours of content
creation by leveraging libraries for reuse in your courses.

:ref:`Analytics in Studio <In-Context Analytics (Teak)>`: Studio now includes
In-Context Analytics, enabling course teams to make data-driven course improvements without switching tools. With a
new button on Course Outline and Unit pages, authors can view insights like
problem correctness rates and video rewatch patterns without leaving the Studio
page. Spot struggling students early and adjust your teaching approach in real
time. *Note: Requires use of the Aspects analytics system.*

:ref:`More Content Blocks Enabled by Default <Content Blocks (Teak)>`: To reduce
technical barriers and improve discoverability, a curated list of high-value content blocks (e.g., Google Docs,
LTI 1.3, Polls, Surveys, Word Cloud) is now enabled by default in Studio. These
can be accessed via the new “Advanced” tile in the unit editor.

:ref:`Studio UI Modernization <Studio Changes (Teak)>`: Studio now features a
modern, streamlined interface by default on all sites.

:ref:`Problem Editor Updates <Problem Editor (Teak)>`: Write clearer,
more flexible problems with Markdown support in the Problem Editor.

:ref:`Improved Preview Experience  <Preview Button (Teak)>`: The “Preview”
button in Studio now uses the default student experience rather than the legacy experience, letting authors
see content exactly as learners will, improving content validation during
authoring.

🎓 For Learners
*****************

:ref:`Give learners credentials they'll want to share<Badging (Teak)>`: In
addition to certificates, learners can now earn digital badges — a
more portable, shareable credential that can be added to social media profiles
and email signatures. While certificates provide detailed achievement records,
badges offer quick, visual proof of skills that employers and peers can easily
recognize. Open edX now integrates directly with Accredible and Credly to issue
and manage these badges. 

⚙️ For Site Operators 
**********************

:ref:`More flexibility for your tech team to build custom features <Teak Frontend Plugin Slots>`: More
plugin slots have been added across the platform to support easier customization and extension by your
development or operations team.

:ref:`Your site, your brand — now faster than ever <Teak Design Tokens>`: Our
new theming system takes only seconds to change, switch,
and deploy your organization's brand themes. Customize your site's look and feel
consistently across your full site. We encourage operators to test out this
system in Teak; it will be required for any theming customization with the Ulmo
upgrade.

🔮 Upcoming in Ulmo (December 2025)
************************************

We're working hard on even more improvements in our Ulmo release! You can look
forward to:

**Advanced Libraries**: Build entire course sections once, then reuse them
everywhere — imagine updating your intro module across 20 courses with one
click!

**Smart Notifications**: Never let students miss important discussions again!
Keep learners engaged with timely alerts about new posts and announcements,
delivered both in-platform and via email.

**Simplified LTI**: Tired of wrestling with LTI integrations? Set up credentials
once and reuse them across all your tools with our streamlined LTI 1.3 plugin.

**Beautiful Course Pages**: Your course catalog is getting a major glow-up! New,
customizable pages will help you showcase courses with modern design and full
theming support.

**Important**: The Ulmo release will require the new theming system. Get ahead
of the curve and test it now so your upgrade is seamless!
