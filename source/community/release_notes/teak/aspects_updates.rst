Aspects Updates
###############

For the upcoming Teak and Ulmo releases, we plan to invest in a few areas to
support content modularity, flexible learner credentialing, and non-degree
credential pathways. We'll expand Individual Learner Dashboards to show learner
progress through content tagged with a particular competency. We'll surface data
in-platform to show how library content is performing across an instance. We'll
give users the ability to define groups of learners, so that they can view what
and how these learners are doing.

The Open edX Teak release comes out in June 2025.
