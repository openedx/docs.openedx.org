Credentials (Badging)
######################

In the Teak release, we are pleased to introduce the capability to issue
`Accredible`_ and `Credly`_ badges from Open edX platform instances.

The Badges feature allows learners to earn achievements (badges) for their learning activities.

Badges provide employers and peers concrete evidence of what you had to do to
earn your credential and what you're now capable of. Digital badges are a
great way to motivate learning, and display a learner's subsequent achievements.
Although digital certificates may display more comprehensive details of an
achievement, some organizations prefer this type of digital credential due to
its increased 'shareability', with badges having the ability to be embedded
easily in more places, such as on social media profiles and email signatures.

Currently, the Open edX Badges service is highly integrated with the `Credly`_ and `Accredible`_ services.

What is Credly?
***************

**Credly** is a end-to-end solution for creating, issuing, and managing digital
Credentials. Organizations use **Credly** to recognize their learners'
achievements. Users use Credly as a professional board to store badges to
visualize their professional success - which courses were completed and when.
Credly also offers labor market insights based on users' skills. Users can
search and apply for job opportunities right through Credly.

What is Accredible?
********************

***Accredible** allows for the design and issue of verifiable digital badges and
certificates that showcase acquired skills, earning criteria, and evidence of
learning. Learn more about Accredible on the `Accredible features page`_.

Enabling Badges
****************

See :ref:`Setting Up Badges` for instructions on how to set up Credly and
Accredible accounts.

Site operators will need to integrate the badging service with their Open edX
instance. Site operators should refer to :doc:`credentials:badges/quickstart`
for details on how to get started.
