More Content Blocks On By Default
##################################

Over the years, the Open edX community has generated dozens of content blocks
that add value to the platform. However, there have been barriers to adoption
and usage of these blocks. Many platform users aren't aware that they exist,
missing opportunities to leverage them and improve their courses and learners'
experiences. Additionally, course authors and educators have had to use JSON to
enable them, which created technical barriers to adoption.

In Teak, a shortlist of content blocks will be on by default--see the list
below. This list was curated based on which blocks generate the highest usage. 

These xblocks will be available via a dropdown list under the “Advanced” tile on
the unit page. The “Advanced” tile will also display in the default Open edX
experience.

Once the "Advanced" tile has been chosen, a list of advanced components is displayed:

In future releases, we will be investing in a better UI for configuring content
blocks, including a dedicated page for managing all course blocks. These
improvements will come in Ulmo.

Which blocks are now on by default?
