.. _Redwood Product Marketing Notes:

Open edX Redwood Release (June 2024)
######################################

Welcome to the Redwood release! Discover new and exciting features built
for authors, learners, and site operators. Here's what's ready for you now:

🧑‍🏫 For Course Authors
********************************

:ref:`Taxonomies and Tags for Easy Organization and Reuse <Content Tagging Release Notes (Redwood)>`:
Add structured tags from any third-party taxonomy (or create your own) to
courses, units, problems, and videos — then search by tag to quickly find and
reuse content across courses, align to certifications, or track learning
outcomes.

:ref:`Meet Aspects: Analytics Built Right Into Open edX <Aspects Release Notes (Redwood)>`:
Access near real-time enrollment, engagement, and performance data through
interactive dashboards directly from the Instructor Dashboard, no separate login
required! With downloadable reports, cross-filtering, and at-risk learner
identification, you'll be able to quickly adapt to the needs of your learners.

:ref:`Find Any Content in Seconds with Course Search <Course Search Redwood>`
(limited release): Search across all your courses (or within one) to
instantly locate videos, problems, or text by keyword or tag — then copy and reuse
content in just a few clicks, saving hours of hunting through course outlines.

:ref:`Studio Gets a Complete Makeover <Studio (Redwood)>`:
Studio now features a sleek, modernized interface, delivering a consistent,
cohesive authoring experience across every page and workflow, built with
authoring efficiency in mind.

:ref:`Share Course Sections Independently <Independent Sections (Redwood)>`:
Hide sections from your course outline while sharing direct URLs to them — perfect
for distributing evergreen resources, supplemental materials, or reference
content that learners need to access throughout the course.

🎓 For Learners
*****************

:ref:`Navigate Your Way With the New Sidebar Navigation <Sidebar Navigation Release Notes (Redwood)>`
(limited release): Learners can now jump to any unit, section, or subsection
without returning to the Course Outline page — with visual progress indicators and
completion checkmarks that update in real-time as they work through content.

⚙️ For Site Operators 
**********************

:ref:`Aspects <openedx-aspects:Aspects Home>` is an analytics system for the
Open edX platform, bringing actionable data about course and learner performance
to instructors and site operators. It must be installed separatly from the Open
edX platform, and in future releases will unlock capabilities such as course
comparison dashboards and Studio in-context metrics.


🔮 Upcoming in Sumac (December 2024)
************************************

We're working hard on even more improvements in our :ref:`Sumac release (out
now) <Sumac Product Marketing Notes>`! You can look forward to:

**Libraries: Your Content, Reimagined**: Store unlimited content in one Library
instead of juggling dozens, then reuse individual problems, videos, or text
blocks across any course with one-click updates. Create randomized problem
banks, organize with Collections and tags, and sync changes instantly across all
your courses.

**Compare Courses at a Glance with Aspects**: Spot enrollment trends, gauge problem
difficulty, and compare performance across all your courses or runs in one
dashboard, complete with sortable tables, course tag filters, and quick links to
drill deeper into individual course data.

**Navigate Your Way: New Sidebar Navigation**: In Sumac, we'll debut a fully
featured, default sidebar navigation experience enabling users to seamlessly
navigate through courses within the courseware experience.

**Enhanced Mobile App Experience**: Single sign-on, improved translations
experience, a new Course Home experience, and more!
