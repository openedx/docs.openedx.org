Aspects Dashboard
#################

The Product and Engineering Teams from eduNEXT and Axim Collaborative are
excited to introduce a new Aspects Dashboard for course administrators with the
upcoming Sumac Release! The new Course Comparison Dashboard will allow users to
easily compare courses and runs by enrollment, number of active users,
high-level performance and video engagement metrics. We've also made
improvements to existing course-level dashboards to make them easier to use.

The Open edX Sumac release comes out in December 2024.
