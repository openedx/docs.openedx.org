Content Libraries Redesign - Beta
#################################

The relaunch of Libraries includes a suite of new features and functionality
that make Libraries centralized hubs for authoring and content management.
Authors can create content independently of the course outline, and reuse it in
as many courses as they'd like, with synced updates. Authors can choose to reuse
single pieces of content independently, or to create pools of content that can
be randomized. Libraries will flexibly hold as much content as needed, with
tools for searching, filtering and adding tags. Users can also create subsets,
or collections of content, within Libraries. The first phase of the relaunch
will include the ability to create and reuse components, add tags, search, and
create content collections.

The Open edX Sumac release comes out in December 2024.
