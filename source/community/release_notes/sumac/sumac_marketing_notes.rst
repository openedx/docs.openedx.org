.. _Sumac Product Marketing Notes:

Open edX Sumac Release (December 2024)
######################################

Welcome to the Sumac release! This release provides significant improvements and
optimizations for authors, learners, and site operators. Here's what's ready for you
now: 

🧑‍🏫 For Course Authors
********************************

:ref:`Libraries: Your Content, Reimagined <Content Libraries Redesign Beta>`:
Store unlimited content in one Library instead of juggling dozens, then reuse
individual problems, videos, or text blocks across any course with one-click
updates. Create randomized problem banks, organize with Collections and tags,
and sync changes instantly across all your courses.

:ref:`Compare Courses at a Glance with Aspects <Aspects Course Comparison Dashboard>`:
Spot enrollment trends, gauge problem difficulty, and compare performance across
all your courses or runs in one dashboard — complete with sortable tables, course
tag filters, and quick links to drill deeper into individual course data.

:ref:`LTI Certified ✅ <Sumac LTI Certification>`: The Open edX Sumac Release
has achieved the `LTI Advantage Complete
<https://www.imsglobal.org/lti-advantage-overview>`_ certification!

🎓 For Learners
*****************

:ref:`Navigate Your Way: New Sidebar Navigation <Sidebar Navigation Release Notes (Sumac)>`:
Learners can now jump to any unit, section, or subsection without returning to
the Course Outline page — with visual progress indicators and completion
checkmarks that update in real-time as they work through content.

:ref:`Enhanced Mobile App Experience <Mobile Updates Sumac>`: Single sign-on,
improved translations experience, a new Course Home experience, and more!

⚙️ For Site Operators 
**********************

:ref:`Customize Your Site Header Without Code Forks <Frontend Slots Header (Sumac)>`:
Site operators can now swap out header elements — like removing the header Help
button — using simple configuration files instead of forking the entire codebase,
making customization faster and easier to maintain.

🔮 Upcoming in Teak (June 2025)
************************************

We're working hard on even more improvements in our :ref:`Teak release (out now) <Teak Product Marketing Notes>`!
You can look forward to:

**Easier Content Reuse with Libraries**: Using Libraries, authors will be able
to create modular units that can be reused in multiple courses. Updates and
changes to content can be managed centrally in Libraries, with changes syncing
seamlessly.

**Aspects Analytics in Studio**: Studio will feature In-Context Analytics, enabling
course teams to make data-driven course improvements without switching tools.

**More Content Blocks Enabled by Default**: A curated list of high-value content
blocks (e.g., Google Docs, LTI 1.3, Polls, Surveys, Word Cloud) will be enabled
by default in Studio.

**Give Learners Credentials They'll Want to Share**: Via integrations with
Credly and Accredible, learners will be able to earn digital badges — a more
portable, shareable credential that can be added to social media profiles and
email signatures. 

**More Flexibility To Build Custom Features**: More plugin slots will be added
across the platform to support easier customization and extension by your
development or operations team.
