earlier LTI builds to bring a more versatile and secure integration model to the
marketplace. Open edX platform providers and LTI 1.3 compliant partners are able to share
a rich set of data thanks to the LTI Core, Assignment and Grade Services,
Names and Role Services, and Deep Linking specifications outlined by 1EdTech. 

For the platform to get LTI Advantage Certified and listed in the `1EdTech

it went through a series of situational tests and verified security operations.
