Open edX Quince Release (December 2023)
########################################

Welcome to the Quince release! Discover new and exciting features for authors,
learners, and site operators. Here's what's ready for you now:

🧑‍🏫 For Course Authors
********************************

:ref:`Copy & Paste Course Components <Copy Paste Quince>`:
Reuse text blocks, problems, videos, and full course units across courses in
seconds — just copy to clipboard and paste wherever you need it, cutting down
content creation time dramatically. 

:ref:`New DemoX Course <DemoX Quince>`: The new DemoX course is available now. There are
five modules that advance from general to specific knowledge and provide
reusable blocks that you can repurpose for your own courses.

🎓 For Learners
*****************

:ref:`Redesigned Learner Home <Learner Home Quince>`:
Learners now have a sleek, modern hub to view enrolled courses, filter by
status, sort by date or title, and quickly resume learning. With improved course
cards and easier navigation for large course lists, the new Learner Home is
another step forward in the platform's evolving design vision.

:ref:`Discussions Right Where You Need Them <Discussions Quince>`:
Learners can now view, respond to, and start discussion threads directly within
course units via a collapsible sidebar - no more navigating away from content to
join the conversation.

⚙️ For Site Operators 
**********************

:ref:`Sell Courses with WooCommerce Integration <WooCommerce Quince>`:
The Open edX platform now integrates directly with WooCommerce, letting you
create course products, process enrollments, handle refunds, and manage seats
without maintaining your own ecommerce infrastructure.

:ref:`See What Learners See <Masquerade Quince>`: Via the new Learner Home,
site staff can now view the platform as users on the platform by typing a username or
email in the “View as” box.


🔮 Upcoming in Redwood (June 2024)
************************************

We're working hard on even more improvements in our :ref:`Redwood release (out
now) <Redwood Product Marketing Notes>`! You can look forward to:

**Taxonomies and Tags for Easy Organization and Reuse**: Add structured tags
from any third-party taxonomy (or create your own) to courses, units, problems,
and videos — then search by tag to quickly find and reuse content across
courses, align to certifications, or track learning outcomes.

**Aspects: Analytics Built Right Into Open edX**: Access near real-time
enrollment, engagement, and performance data through interactive dashboards
directly from the Instructor Dashboard.

**Find Any Content in Seconds with Course Search**: Search across all your
courses (or within one) to instantly locate videos, problems, or text by keyword
or tag. Copy and reuse content in just a few clicks, saving hours of hunting
through course outlines.

**Studio Glowup**: Studio will debut a sleek, modernized interface, delivering a
consistent, cohesive authoring experience across every page and workflow, built
with authoring efficiency in mind.

**Share Course Sections Independently**: Hide sections from your course outline
while sharing direct URLs to them, perfect for distributing evergreen resources,
supplemental materials, or reference content that learners need to access
throughout the course.
