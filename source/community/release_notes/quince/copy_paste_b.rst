Copy & Paste - Second Phase Release
###################################

The Open edX Community Product Team is excited to announce the release of the
second phase of Copy & Paste!

Earlier this year, we launched the first phase of the Copy & Paste feature (see
:doc:`copy_paste_a`), which allowed authors to copy and reuse course components
(text blocks, video blocks and problem blocks) from one course to another. With
the release of phase two, authors will also be able to copy and reuse course
units from one course to another. Authors no longer need to create content from
scratch when they want to reuse it in another course, such as reuse of evergreen
content. This saves time and improves efficiency.

Authors can utilize the unit copy-past functionality from one of two places:

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

From the Course Outline page
****************************

From the Course Outline page, authors can copy a unit by clicking the triple dot
menu at the top of the unit block and selecting :guilabel:`Copy to Clipboard`.

When building a subsection in the course outline, an option to :guilabel:`Paste
Unit` appears:

From the Unit page
******************

From the Unit page, authors can copy a unit by clicking on the :guilabel:`Copy Unit`
button in the right-hand sidebar.

   .. image:: /_images/release_notes/quince/copy_paste_b3.png

Authors can then paste the unit into any subsection via the new :guilabel:`Paste as New
Unit`` dropdown modal in the top horizontal navigation. Authors can also paste
Units copied from the Unit Page into the Course Outline, and vice versa.

Be sure to see the How-To guide on :doc:`/educators/how-tos/copy_paste_course_content`.

Copy & Paste for both components and units are available in the Open edX Quince Release.
