Stay Up To Date with Verawood
##############################

Beginning with the Redwood release, the community has come together to pre-plan
major product deliverables well in advance of the release's code cut off date.
This planning process is an open, synchronous meeting which anyone may join,
whether to discuss projects they're contributing or to follow along to get a
front row seat to the next release's deliverables. Coordination across community
projects in this way allows us to have more predictable feature sets available
in each release, facilitates assistance across the community for projects that
may be falling behind, and prevent duplicative work - which streamlines efforts
and reduces redundancy.

The Named Release Planning meeting occurs biweekly on Thursdays starting January
9th 2025, and can be found on the `Open edX Meeting Calendar`_.
Join asynchronously in the `#release-planning room in Slack <openedx.org/slack>`_.
