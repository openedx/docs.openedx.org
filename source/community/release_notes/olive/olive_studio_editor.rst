Improved Studio Editing in Olive
################################

With the recent release of Olive, the newest Open edX named release, comes some
significant improvements to the text editing experience within what was formerly
known as the “HTML Component”. With this new feature, it's easier to add things
to your text, such as:

* images from your image gallery
* special characters and symbols
* emoticons

Editing is also more streamlined, with new enhancements such as:

* editing in full-screen mode
* undo / redo actions
* table authoring without going into HTML mode

Read on for a rundown of everything you need to know about the Text Component.

Updated Editor Overview
***********************

The visual above shows the updated Text component editor, which opens up in
full-screen mode, allowing you to seamlessly build blocks with large amounts of
content. It has a new toolbar that starts with undo (backwards arrow) and redo
(forward arrow) actions, existing formatting options, text layout tools, and
list and indentation controls. Additional details for the remaining tools are
described below.

Adding Images
*************

We have made it easier to reference existing files & uploads from your course in
text components as shown in the visual below. You can search and sort all images
as well as upload new images to your course as you are authoring a specific text
component.

Special Characters
******************

We have also introduced a way to include special characters
into your text content, including mathematical and symbolic elements.

Emoticon Support 
****************

You can now also easily add emoticons into your text content, a small but
visually obvious way to break up long stretches of text content. You can see the
emoticon library tool referenced below.

Visual Table Editor
*******************

Another category of new tools we have added includes the addition of tables
without needing to jump to the HTML editor. The table toolbar icon lets you drop
in a table component:

Selecting a given cell of the table within the editor view lets you create,
remove, or adjust rows and columns:

Dragging one of the table's corners allows you to resize it:

The remaining two buttons on the toolbar are *Clear Formatting* and *HTML Edit*.

Clear Formatting allows you to highlight any amount of formatted text and revert
its formatting. HTML Edit allows you to view the raw HTML of the Text Component;
you may adjust the HTML directly, if you wish.

We hope this improved editor will speed up the content authoring process and
enable you to create richer experiences for your learners!
