########################################

Welcome to the Olive release! This release provides significant improvements and
optimizations for authors and learners. Here's what's ready for you now:

🧑‍🏫 For Course Authors
********************************

:ref:`Enhanced Text Editing in Studio<Olive editing>`:
Author text components faster with full-screen editing, visual table creation,
one-click image insertion from your gallery, special characters, emoticons, and
undo/redo - all without touching HTML code.

:ref:`Powerful Moderation Tools for Discussions <Olive discussions moderation>`:
With the :ref:`new Discussions experience <Olive discussions>`, moderators can now
endorse answers, close or edit posts with documented reasons, track learner
activity and reported content, plus enable discussions for any unit with a
single checkbox rather than manual topic configuration.

:ref:`Integrate Third-Party Discussion Tools <Olive discussions 3party>`:
Connect your courses with Ed Discussion, Yellowdig, InScribe, or Piazza via
LTI - bringing advanced features like analytics dashboards, graded discussions,
LaTeX support, and collaborative wiki-style answers directly into your learning
experience.

:ref:`Control Course Features in One Place <Olive pr>`:
Turn course tools like Progress pages, Wiki, Calculator, and Discussions on or
off with a single click — no more digging through advanced settings to enable
features your learners need.


🎓 For Learners
*****************

:ref:`Redesigned Discussion Forums <Olive discussions>`:
Navigate conversations faster with a tabbed interface, mark answers to
questions, search across content and users, like posts inline, and track
activity with interactive post summaries, plus improved moderation tools for
course teams.

:ref:`Reset Randomized Problem Banks <Olive randomized>`:
Perfect for flashcard-style study sessions and repeated practice, learners can
now practice exam prep by resetting randomized content blocks to get fresh
questions from a course's problem bank.

:ref:`User Login Glowup <Olive login>`: Olive provides a
streamlined registration, sign in, and Forgot Password experience.

🔮 Upcoming in Palm (June 2023)
**************************************

We're working hard on even more improvements in our :ref:`Palm release (out
now) <Palm Product Marketing Notes>`! You can look forward to:

**Redesigned Problem Editor**: Create and edit problems in a full-screen visual
editor without writing Markdown. The new editor features answer options,
scoring, and settings all in one place, plus live previews and easy access to
advanced OLX when you need it.

**Streamlined ORA Grading**: Grade open response assessments faster with
side-by-side rubrics, file previews (PDFs, images, text), team coordination
features, and batch grading, all in one intuitive interface that lets you review
multiple submissions without switching screens.

**Issue Verifiable Digital Credentials**: Learners will be able to share
tamper-proof, instantly verifiable program credentials to digital wallets,
giving them portable proof of accomplishments they control and can present to
employers, schools, or anyone they choose in seconds.

**Schedule Emails to Students**: Instructors will be able to schedule course
emails to send later instead of immediately - perfect for timing announcements,
reminders, and updates when students are most likely to engage.
