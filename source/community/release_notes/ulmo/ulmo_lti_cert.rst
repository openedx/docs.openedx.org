Ulmo Release is LTI Advantage Complete Certified
#################################################

The Open edX Ulmo Release has achieved the `LTI Advantage Complete
<https://www.imsglobal.org/lti-advantage-overview>`_ certification.

Implemented by 1EdTech, the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) Advantage set of services improves on
earlier LTI builds to bring a more versatile and secure integration model to the
marketplace. Open edX platform providers and LTI 1.3 compliant partners are able to share
a rich set of data thanks to the LTI Core, Assignment and Grade Services,
Names and Role Services, and Deep Linking specifications outlined by 1EdTech. 

For the platform to get LTI Advantage Certified and listed in the `1EdTech
Product Directory
<https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications/axim-collaborative/open-edx-platform>`_,
it went through a series of situational tests and verified security operations.
A product that completes certification testing for core LTI 1.3 and all three
LTI Advantage services is recognized as LTI Advantage Complete.
