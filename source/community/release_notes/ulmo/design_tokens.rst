.. _Ulmo Design Tokens:

Design Tokens (New Theming System)
##################################

In Ulmo, Design Tokens - a new way of comprehensive theming - will debut. This
theming system makes it much easier to theme your full site, including the Open
edX mobile applications.

.. warning::

    Open edX site operators should be sure to follow this page for updates on the upcoming changes. There will be no overlap between the old theming system and Design Tokens, so site operators will need to prepare for the changes in advance of the Ulmo release.

See this presentation from the November 2024 Open edX meetup for more detail.
