them across all courses and blocks, eliminating repetitive data entry and
reducing configuration errors across your entire instance.

has achieved the `LTI Advantage Complete
<https://www.imsglobal.org/lti-advantage-overview>`_ certification!

delivered both in-platform and via email.

Course Home carousel showing progress, videos, assignments, and grades at a
glance. Also included is a redesigned Content tab with filtered views and a
dedicated Progress page to track achievement.

⚙️ For Site Operators

🔮 Upcoming in Verawood (June 2026)
************************************

We're working hard on even more improvements in our Verawood release! You can look
forward to:

**Roles and Permissions Improvements in Studio**: A more granular, nuanced way
of granting privileges to course staff and instructors.

**Modular Pathway Support**: This initiative aims to create a unified,
generalized, flexible way for course teams, instructional designers and
administrators to sequence, bundle and deliver learning pathways, including
microcredentials, small courses, pathways and more. For Verawood, the Open edX
platform will support stackable pathways for programs.

**Instructor Dashboad Overhaul**: A beautiful, themeable Instructor Dashboard
with numerous usability improvements is coming your way.

**Reliable, Repeatable LTI Units**: Configuration integrity when duplicating LTI
blocks and improved compatibility with Content Libraries, enabling reliable
block-level reusability and reducing the need for repeated configuration across
courses.

**AI Extension Framework**: By leveraging existing backend and frontend plugins,
the Open edX platform will support adding diverse AI tools to the platform (both
LMS and Studio) as extensions.
