Getting Help with Open edX
###########################

.. note::

   If you are unable to find what you need here or need more help than the
   documentation provides, we'd love to hear about it via the :doc:`feedback`.

To get more help we recommend checking out the `Open edX Forums`_.
Make sure to search the forums before posting a
new question in case others have had the same question as you.

The community also has a `slack workspace
<https://openedx.org/slack>`_ where we coordinate more timely
tasks. If you need help, we recommend posting in the forums over posting in
slack.  The forums retain more history and tend to get more thoughtful
responses.

Finally, if you would like to get in touch with Axim and/or our Open edX partners, see the `Getting Help page`_ on the Open edX website. Note that response times here may be slower than the other options.

*******************************************
Information to Provide When Asking for Help
*******************************************

Keep in mind when asking for help that you have much more knowledge of your
situation than others do.  You need to provide that context so that people can
understand your problem and provide good help.  
To make it easier for others to help you, please provide the following types of
information.

* **What you are trying to do?**  What version of the code are you installing,
  and why? What is your larger goal?

* **What you have done?**  What instructions were you following? What commands
  did you run? Did you deviate from the instructions at any point, even a
  little bit?  Full output of those commands, even if it seems overwhelming,
  can be very useful.

* **What has gone wrong?**  Are there errors in log files? Did you get specific
  failures in the terminal?  Provide full details about the undesired results
  you saw.

While working through your problem, helpers often need additional information.
Stay involved in the discussion, and try to give them what they need. They know
best what information they need to solve the problem.

   The Open edX community has agreed upon a shared `code of conduct
