Getting Help
############

.. note::

   If you are unable to find what you need here or need more help than the
   documentation provides, we'd love to hear about it via the :doc:`feedback`.

To get more help we recommend checking out the `Open edX Forums
<https://discuss.openedx.org>`_. Make sure to search the forums before posting a
new question in case others have had the same question as you.

The community also has a `slack workspace
<https://openedx.org/slack>`_ where we coordinate more timely
tasks. If you need help, we recommend posting in the forums over posting in
slack.  The forums retain more history and tend to get more thoughtful
responses.

.. note::

   The Open edX community has agreed upon a shared `code of conduct
   <https://openedx.org/code-of-conduct/>`_, please be sure to review it.
